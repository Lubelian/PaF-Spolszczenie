gdynia.5.t: "[GetNewspaper]Anarchy in Gdynia Ends"
gdynia.5.desc: "Ever since the Ark departed, so did any authority with it and Gdynia turned into a city of total chaos. The people, fed up with the club’s policies and their expenses to just build the Ark, went to streets and started to riot. The City Council, closed ever since Arka Gdynia declared independence from Kashubia, decided to reconvene and take matters in their hands and negotiate with the rioters..\n\nOne may think that the troubles in Gdynia are over, but they don’t see that the Council is deeply divided. Unified at time of troubles, the cracks started to show once they dealt with the problems. To resolve this conflict, the Council announced it will hold presidential elections to let people decide. One thing is known: the region is no longer safe and Gdynia must find a powerful ally and the election might either save the city, or doom it forever."
gdynia.5.a: "The Gdynians must choose wisely"
