unification.66.t: "[GetNewspaper]The Vandals unify Opolskie!"
unification.66.desc: "Today Opole was place where an extraordinary event happened, where soldiers dressed in tribal suits marched across Old City. Their rhytmic drums, along with fifes made a spectacle for the masses. \n\nSzydłowski, self-proclaimed Chief of Vandal Tribe, has started along with his soldiers seizing catholic church property. Right now it is unknown, if his 'Warband' will be able to convince populace of Voivodeship to his rightful rule over newly gained territories.\n\n Although, what is known is that Opolskie Voivodeship just got under 'new management'."
