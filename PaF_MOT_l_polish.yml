unification.72.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Motorcracy of Gorzów unifies Northern Greater Poland"
unification.72.desc:0 "Tonight, fragments of the S3, 24 and 92 connecting Gorzów Wielkopolski with Poznań will relive their pre-Fall lives for a day, as a massive horde of TIR trucks, motorbikes and cars is set to roll from one city to another in a Roman-style triumph celebrating the complete conquest of the northern halves of Lubusz and Greater Polish voivodeships by the so-called Motorcracy of Gorzów - a joint ''government'' of marauding roughnecks united in their love of breakneck speeds. \n\nDespite the limited availability of fuel in the country, the veteran speedfreaks of the Motorcracy overtook the local warlording Poles and Germans and made it to the finish line, securing the trophy that is northern Greater Poland for themselves."
unification.72.a:0 "On the open roads, they are truly free."
