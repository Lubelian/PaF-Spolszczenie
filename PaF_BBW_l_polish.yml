BBW_steam_power: "Industrializm bez granic"
BBW_steam_power_desc: ""Technologia przemysłowa, zakazana w innych krajach pod nawoływaniem ekofaszystów, po raz kolejny ukazuje swoje zalety i triumfuje. Jesteśmy jednym z ostatnich bastionów rozumu i wolności, do którego nie sięgają jeszcze łapy klimatystów. Energia czarnego złota nie tylko napędza silniki tramwajów parowych, elektrowni i maszyn, ale także napełnia nasze serca ogromną dumą. Niestety, w wyniku wieloletnich zaniedbań i ideologicznie motywowanego zielonego lobbowania, pozostajemy w tyle za naszymi sąsiadami, jeśli chodzi o rozwój sprzętu i technologii górnictwa odkrywkowego. Jednakże z każdym dniem jesteśmy coraz bliżej uwolnienia prawdziwego potencjału węgla, a kiedy nadejdzie ten czas, zdrowy rozsądek w końcu zatriumfuje nad kłamstwami ekologów i zostanie ujawniony całemu światu jako jedyna prawdziwa droga do postępu!""

BBW_smog: "Poziom zanieczyszczeń: mniejszy"
BBW_smog_desc: "Zielony faszyzm potrzebuje swoich mitów po to, aby mógł istnieć. Jak we wszystkich totalitarnych systemach, idole, w których nie można, kwestionować potrzebują utrzymać iluzję, która daje im wytchnienie od myślenia. Najbardziej żałosnym fetyszem zielonych szaleńców jest na pewno smog. Każda nieco ciemniejsza chmura, każdy nawet najbardziej subtelny zapach ciężkiej uczciwej pracy i sukcesu sprawia, że ekolodzy dostają świra. Cóż, rozpieszczone zwierzęta w klatce, które nie znają, prawdziwego życia nigdy nie miały okazji zrozumieć jakim błogosławieństwem dla ludzkości jest brudna tania energia z udowodnionych źródeł."

For those who still bother to keep up with national news, a single publication adorns the newspaper stands – 'do Rzeczy', the jewel of the Brotherhood’s propaganda apparatus, printed in enough of a volume to provide one to every poor sod in the city. On the side, stacks of papers litter the tiny structure’s shelves – unsold copies from the previous few days left there in case anyone forgot to read yesterday’s edition. The quality of the articles is quite poor, their content is ideologically-charged drivel and journalistic integrity has long gone out the window. So why do hundreds of thousands of residents spend their hard-earned money every day on something they can hardly read with a straight face? Well, the reason is simple. When a paladin comes to your workplace to judge your loyalty and questions you about your stance on recent events, you don’t want to be caught accidentally spouting Wiechowite propaganda."

But we will not compromise by allowing hostile elements into our ranks. That could only end in disaster. Even if we're inevitably thinning out the pool of potential draftees, we will remain pure. Thankfully, the Academy of Common Sense is there to shape whoever decides to join us into true patriots, free of revisionist thought, loyal to their country and the Brotherhood."

Będą błagali o przerwę, będą błagać o krótsze dyżury, ale dla malkontentów mamy tylko jedną odpowiedź - Panie Areczku, 8-godzinne zmiany są przeznaczone dla zarząd, dla Ciebie mamy tylko 12-godzinny dzień pracy."

Zawiera wszystkie białka potrzebne do utrzymania metabolizmu i wzrostu mięśni. Wzmacniają także układ odpornościowy i chronią nas przed wszelkiego rodzaju chorobami. Co więcej, mięso dostarcza naszemu organizmowi wielu niezbędnych witamin, makro i mikroelementów. Przy tak wielu zaletach nic dziwnego, że nasi przodkowie jedli wyłącznie żywność pochodzenia zwierzęcego! Z drugiej strony naukowcy odkryli, że warzywa w dużej mierze są niezgodne z naszym układem trawiennym systemów i często wyrządzają nam więcej szkody niż pożytku. W końcu ludzie to nie króliki, tylko dumni mięsożercy.

Bełchatów i Łódź każdego dnia zapełniają się bez środków do życia ze wszystkich zakątków Polski. Masowo wyrzucani na przepełnione ciężarówki, kazano im zostawić wszystko za sobą i rozpocząć życie od nowa. Wszystko dlatego, że odkryto, że domy ich przodków stoją na ziemi bogatej w zasoby. Niektórzy nieuchronnie znajdą drogę powrotną na szczyt i zapewnią sobie wygodne życie w wielkich ośrodkach miejskich Bractwa. Większość dołączą do ciemnego podziemia miast lub po prostu zaczną żebrać o resztki na tętniących życiem ulicach. Łączy ich jednak jedno: czy to w nowych mieszkaniach, barach, czy pod pustym niebem, na wspomnienie spokojne życie, jakie kiedyś wiodły. O życiach, które zostały im odebrane."

Everything so that once in combat, a single Paladin will be enough to take out a hundred enemy combatants. With his own bare hands if necessary, bludgeoning his foes with his gun once ammo runs out.

One moment our garrisons watch the frontlines with boredom, the next, they find themselves in the middle of an enemy assault. But among all possible targets, there is one that all bandits and hostile forward formations consistently avoid - the Brotherhood. All because before they would even have time to deal with the first wave of defenders, they would find themselves overwhelmed by a hailstorm of bullets from our First Contact Forces - able to respond to any threat in a matter of minutes. Now even our border towns can feel safe knowing no looters will ever dare face our wrath."

It's no easy task to completely reinvent armored warfare, especially when you're starting from scratch with only the burned remains of Polish tanks to draw conclusions from. Besides, we can't have everything. We could try to cram as many features into our vehicles as possible, but ultimately, we'd be left with inoperable abominations with no real use on the battlefield. We have to make a decision - either we look for designs that pack as much of a punch as possible to dismantle our enemies in a single blow or we could aim to overwhelm them with unparalleled speed. The choice is up to the council."

BBW_future_tanks_hard_desc: "A peaceful silence spreads across the battlefield. It's quiet. Too quiet. Suddenly, a bang. A single shot and the enemy vehicle bursts into flames. The infantry flees, only to be mowed down. They never stood a chance. Before they could fully comprehend the danger before them, their lives have been ended by the Brotherhood's main battle tanks. Precise, stealthy, but above all, deadly, the vehicles draw from decades of armor development to deliver unmatched firepower in a compact steel package. Capable of singlehandedly dispatching entire battalions and tough enough to withstand hits from just about anything the enemy could throw at us, the conclusion for our foes upon spotting these machines is clear - the battle has already been lost."

BBW_future_tanks_koala_desc: "They say our megalomania blinds us. That it makes us weak, too obsessed with impractical grandeur. They'd be hard-pressed to repeat that when staring down the barrel of a Koala tank. As lesser men fight and die by thousands on the battlefield below, an unholy beast of steel towers above them. Proud, dominant, superior. It knows no words, only destruction. From its maw, hellfire, in the form of explosive shells, spews on anyone who would dare oppose us. Though they may turn their guns on it in the desperate hope of stopping its rampage, a Koala tank cannot be slain by mere mortal men. It shall only rest once its bloodlust has been sated. When all its enemies are dead."

Well, if one were to hear the roar of the guns of Saint Barbara, they'd be forgiven to consider it enchanted by the God of Death himself. With the mighty battery bearing destruction from afar, no enemy will ever be allowed to let their breath rest, no matter how many layers of fortifications they hide behind. Everything will crumble before our might, even if the earth itself has to break under the force of our bombardment. Let them feel fear as the shell shock scrambles their minds. Let them grovel in hopes of a merciful surrender. All we have for them is death. Their best hope is to quickly find its sweet embrace."

BBW_climatology_institute_spirit_desc: "The great climate lie has permeated nearly every layer of Polish society. As Western media continues to bombard us with falsified reports about the made-up 'Climate Change,' the Institute of Climatology stands as the sole shield debunking their ridiculous claims and protecting the minds of our people from falling to green propaganda. Whether it be proving that hot summers and snowless winters are nothing but local weather alterations or showing that smog is, in fact, mostly harmless, the Institute deals with obvious truths, turning common sense conclusions into both sophisticated studies and easy-to-read graphs. Fighting against the entire globalist media apparatus and its billions in dark money funding won't be an easy task, but ultimately, we have the winning position. They can keep churning out their heinous lies, all we have to do is keep beating them back with our cold, hard facts."

BBW_press_institute_spirit_desc: "The press can be a dangerous tool in the hands of demagogues. Some corrupt it to claim that the planet is dangerously approaching a climate crisis. Others use it to demonize coal and other cheap power sources. Certain publications even dare to meddle directly in our affairs and label our benevolent government as an illegitimate, dictatorial hellscape posing a threat not just to Poland but to the whole world. While we can do little about the publishing of these lies beyond our borders, we have at least been able to curtail their spread within them. The censorship we employ is not a case of tyrannical overreach but rather of necessity. We stand alone against an international coalition of ecological madmen. The least we could do is ensure their propaganda doesn't poison the minds of our citizens."

Now, young adepts of Common Sense can finally pursue higher education that teaches them the truth, and only the truth. In our first Brotherhood University, we have redefined the fundamental curriculum, getting rid of useless, decadent classes in the arts and whatever the hell 'gender studies' was. In their place, we have put courses in resource management and processing, metallurgy, geoengineering, and many more necessary, practical skills to raise an educated, but hardworking populace specialized in the areas of life that truly matter."

They're bulky and impractical, but it can't be denied, they get the job done. Encased in steel, our workers are able to reach levels of productivity unmatched anywhere across the world. Even in countries that claim to be at the forefront of innovation, workers break their backs hauling loads of a dozen kilograms. Here? Try hundreds. Effortlessly. We're not just catching up to the superpowers, we're outright surpassing them. This is the birth of a new industrial revolution, and this time, we're leading it."

BBW_falling_economy: "Upadająca gospodarka"
BBW_falling_economy_desc: "All good things must eventually come to an end. The Brotherhood's prosperity was no different. When coal supplies dwindled, air pollution damaged the agricultural sector beyond repair, and public trust in the government plummeted, the beautiful scenes of power and splendor displayed on our propaganda posters became just that - propaganda. Little remains of the promised industrial utopia, and with each passing day, the prospect of ever reclaiming it drifts further away from reality. The same masses once lulled by superficial comfort and a heavy dose of ideological trickery now find themselves forced to abandon all civility in order to survive. As chaos spreads beyond any control, perhaps the Brotherhood's luck has finally run out."
BBW_reviving_economy: "Ożywienie gospodarcze"
BBW_reviving_economy_desc: "We were pushed to the brink of collapse, but, as always, the Brotherhood's ingenuity will triumph. The worst has blown over, yet now we face the humongous task of building back everything that was destroyed during the times of crisis. Once more, the people flock back, seeking our protection, knowing only we can provide them any semblance of safety. The factories resume their infernal churn, and life slowly returns to normal, though a scar forever adorns our nation. Restoring confidence in our government will be a long and arduous process, but one promise soothes the painful thought of the work still required for the country to fully recuperate - a crisis such as this will never be allowed to happen again."

In order to truly reform it, we first have to cut off the head and then build back up from the bottom. The ideological parasites will squirm, but we'll remove the rot from within, one by one until we have a military that actually works for us and for the people of Poland."
BBW_reformed_army4_desc: "It's over. The army's influence has finally been curtailed. It took far more trouble than we'd initially anticipated and even a full-blown rebellion to get there, but we finally have a military that we can truly call loyal. It will take some time to fully train the new cadres and commanders, but the purging of old political doctrines opened the door to many volunteers who'd previously do anything to avoid enlisting. But what matters most is that we have built a force to guard the peace, not mindlessly wage war like Ziemkiewicz's band of fanatics."
BBW_greenisation_of_brotherhood: "Zielenizacja Bractwa"

It spreads its roots out, reclaiming the now-desolate land systematically stolen from its kind. The plant knows it not but had it blossomed just a few years earlier, it would find itself cut down just as soon as its first leaves sprouted, deemed a harmful weed fit only to be removed from the earth it calls home. Instead, it will be nourished, provided everything to help it survive in the hostile environment its protectors call Poland. No prize will be given to Gaia's bravest pioneer, and its life will mostly be a constant struggle against the toxic soil, but the plant's stubborn defiance of the unhabitable conditions will forever be remembered - immortalized in the strength of its descendants as they return the land to Mother Nature."
BBW_resettlement_efforts: "Wysiłki przesiedleńcze"
BBW_resettlement_efforts_desc: "The once-random resettlements of populations from resource-rich areas have now practically become an institution, as newly displaced masses arrive in Bełchatów daily. At least we can finally provide them with state-funded housing - a meager compensation for the loss of their lifelong homes, but still a reasonable token of our goodwill nonetheless. The massive projects built entirely from smog bricks welcome their new residents. In time they'll learn to love their appointed dwellings, even if they end up needing a while to accomodate to breathing in the heavily polluted air of their living quarters."
BBW_maximized_processing: "Zmaksymalizowane przetwarzanie"
BBW_maximized_processing_desc: "Long commutes have always stifled our employees' productivity. Inevitably, some people will always live far from their workplaces and, therefore, continuously show up at their job sites tired and attempt to leave them at the earliest moment of convenience. And while countless governments in supposedly 'developed' countries failed to tackle this fundamental problem, we have solved it with a solution so ingenious yet so simple that it's shocking nobody came up with it before us. Our workers don't have to waste even a modicum of productivity when they never exit their factory in the first place! Now they can spend all day contributing to the Brotherhood's prosperity. Surely they must be thankful for the ability to dedicate their lives to something greater than themselves."

BBW_korean_potatoes_desc: "We can't deny it forever - our people are starving. Importing potatoes from an ideological enemy is perhaps the most heretical thing we could do, but sometimes, we have to dip into the well of pragmatism. Unfit for consumption by anyone with even a modicum of self-respect, the tubers will be distributed amongst our most destitute citizens. Hopefully, they're enough to make a difference."

BBW_regionalisation_brotherhood_desc: "The unitary model of the Brotherhood has proven insufficient to manage the disparate lands under our control. Extending the already-overstretched tendrils of Bełchatów's administration into the furthest corners of Poland has become increasingly difficult and time-consuming, forcing us to completely reinvent our model of governance and divide the day-to-day activities between several regional chapters. It makes sense. After all, a factory in Silesia can't operate under the same regulations as one in Łódź. There is also one added benefit to this new system - giving near-complete authority to the hand-picked Magistrate Paladins allows them to utilize all means necessary to crack down on any dissent within their territory without risking any repercussions for the top brass in the capital. If they go overboard, all we have to do is replace them, no harm done."
BBW_full_plastic_production: "Mass Plasticifying of Woods"
BBW_full_plastic_production_desc: "At the heart of Poland's forests, or at least whatever of them still remains, industrial machines tirelessly operate. They cut down the last few free-standing oaks and maples, but they are not some careless barbarians. In fact, they already have the trees' replacements ready - better, artificial versions made purely from plastic. One by one, the woods clear out, and a sea of synthetic constructs takes their place. Some might mourn the systematic destruction of the last patches of organized greenery, but we see it differently - we are conquering nature, and soon, we will be able to deliver the final blow."

I can't sit here forever, but what should I do? If we try to get the situation under control, we will turn out to be as souless as the PiS rabble from before the war. No, we can't be like them. One must wait and pray that time will heal all wounds. The guards will be on high alert, but I hope they won't have to leave the barracks. It's over for today.

Although they were handcuffed, they still threatened that the days of the Brotherhood were numbered, that someone would finally take us on and that the power plants would be left as nothing but rubble. And the slogans about killing nature... Is that our reward for trying to maintain at least a little bit of normality for these people?

Besides, there would be no end to the wars to take control of the power plant. Everyone would like to own it, and this could lead to chaos and destruction of the facility. So we need to sit down at the table and talk. The Bełchatów Railway Station is bursting at the seams with all kinds of materials sent as payment for electricity. It is not known how long this condition will last, I hope as long as possible."

BBW_the_power_of_steam_desc: "Although crucial, coal alone is not the only component of a healthy economy. Without steel, it is impossible to successfully extract it, fight other contenders for power or build houses in the place of ruins. Even though we do not have direct iron deposits, scrap metal around us is abundant. It is considered gross by some to recycle, but in fact it is a whole new production cycle. Our new American economics expert, Christian Paulson, believes so.\n\nAfter all, recycling is basically an individual activity, and here a large plant will be responsible for it. If its area formally covers all our dominion, then there will be no question of collecting garbage but only "using scattered warehouses of semi-finished materials"\n\nThat is why it was rightly recognized at the meeting of the Council that building a large steam scrap yard is a historic necessity. The Steam Combine "Citadel" will soon be operational. You can already see the smoke over Parzno, the blackest one can imagine.\n\nThousands of tons of steel each year ready to be turned into something useful..."

BBW_financial_surpluses_desc: "I am going to visit the grand opening of a new unit at the power plant in an hour. Thanks to the money from exports and skilful management, we managed to get the necessary materials. Soon, the narrow stream of energy flowing to the market will turn into a real Yangtze. Chances are our "trading partners" won't be able to resist it.\n\nMoreover, along with the new unit, new plants will be built and those for which there was no capacity before, will be reopened as well. It's wonderful to be rich. Everyone will admit it. And the more wealth the better. Hence the new Council decision to allocate a portion of the money directly to the people. In the end, they deserve it and the money released onto the market will come back to us anyway. As it always should be."

BBW_purchase_of_weapons_desc: "A secret associate of the Brotherhood has just arrived from Łódź. He brought great news about a new deal on the black market. Apparently, one of the smuggling groups got into the old military warehouse. Our associate got a suitcase filled with dollars, a souvenir bag full of dust, and quickly left. The delivery is expected to arrive within a few weeks. Our knights can't wait for something better than 10mm pistols to fall into their hands. The worst ones will go to the new units, we will finally have enough equipment for them."

A society suspended in a constant state of insecurity will keep living in fear. There is no other way to go about it. There was nothing new said at the meeting, no groundbreaking or drastic ideas. Not to its members at least. An ordinary, conformist somebody would've had his hair stand on its ends if he had heard the monotonous, even mechanical conversations about all the monstrosities that the future will bring.\n\nBut first things first.

How ironic that with the use of paper made from trees they spread their message of a green future. Another example of the hypocrisies of the Wiechowszczyzna.

BBW_warzecha_report_desc: "Our efforts at unifying the voivodeship’s power grid have turned out to be a farce! Previous reports of our Power Plant being able to sustain the entire region's power usage twofold ended up being just lies and overly optimistic propaganda, undoing months of development and years of future plans. To contain this crisis before it gets completely out of hand, I have tasked Sentinel Warzecha with assessing the situation on the ground and figuring out who’s responsible for the falsified documents.\nOne thing is certain, however...\n§RHeads will roll for this§!."
BBW_SYSTEM_OVERLOAD_desc: "I haven’t seen riots this bad since the Trial of Three back in ‘27. This time, however, no matter how tempting the idea sounds, we can’t just blame them on Wiech. No, that would be too far of a stretch at this point. The masses would see through our deception and things would only get worse. I'm sure we'll find a use for this outburst once things have calmed down a bit, but for now, these protests have to be crushed. We need the people back in the mines, back in the factories, and back in their place! ...Or else this Blackout will never go away."
BBW_electricity_stamps_desc: "Rationing electricity... How low will we have to stoop to fix this shortage?\nI’ll need to jump through some pretty painful hoops to rationalize the introduction of stamp cards to the Paladins. After all, most among our upper echelons at the very least grew up when they were first around, creating lifelong resentment towards anything curbing their excess. This may lead to some uncomfortable comparisons, but this is the only solution I can think of that doesn’t require a whole cadre of professionals. Ones that we currently don’t have."
BBW_blow_up_lodz_desc: "The situation is dire and true recovery will take a long time, in the meantime, however, it would be prudent to take our eyes off the matters at hand and redirect our population’s sights toward other issues. Namely, the exclusion zone in Bałuty. Through carefully weaved rhetoric and some... rather large stretches of the imagination, responsibility for the radioactive wasteland can be pinned on the damned Wiechowszczyzna and the puppet masters of Europe in Berlin, stoking further resentment towards our enemies."
BBW_temporary_adepts_desc: "Our security forces are heavily understaffed, there are no questions to be had about that. Following Head Paladin Rzymkowski’s recommendation, I’ve greenlit a plan to use some of our less egregious dissidents to bolster the ranks of our Adepts. They’ll need some very thorough training to fully clear their minds of any green delusions potentially clouding their rational thinking, but there’s nothing that some strict discipline and punishment can’t achieve. In the coming weeks, they’ll learn more about Common Sense than they’ve done for all their lives thus far... whether they want it or not."
BBW_crisis_staff_desc: "As much as I hate to admit it, an emergency of this magnitude cannot be solved merely through words and preventative half-measures. This situation calls for a well-organized group of experts, led by someone we can fully trust. For that reason, I’ve made the decision to induce Paladin Wróblewski into our inner circle. From now on, he will be the watchful eye presiding over a think tank made up of our brightest scribes, tasked with mitigating the Blackout’s effects.

For that purpose, they will participate in extracurricular, vocational activities that will turn them into exemplary members of the Brotherhood. More difficult work will also be an option for those who really want to prove their worth. In exchange for better grades or some trinket payment, teens will be heavily incentivized to take up work in the mines or receive military training alongside our most loyal men."

Membership will be entirely voluntary, of course, but what proud parent wouldn’t want their child to be part of such an organization? With all that said, however, there is still one more issue left to be dealt with - the question of leadership. Given the group's nature, I feel I am left with only two options: Roksana Węgiel or Jakub Zgierski. Roksana's popularity would be great for PR, but on the other hand, Jakub's dedication to our ideals is basically unshaken.\n\nI'll really need to think this over, as this choice could prove crucial in determining the organization's direction."
BBW_take_whoever_you_can_desc: "There are hundreds of working-age men out there, pointlessly meandering about and being a dead weight on our economy. Even now, with almost daily power outages, they show no initiative in trying to fix the issue. Do they not know that the Blackout won’t just end by itself? Regardless of what they may think, we’ll need to give them a... helping hand in realizing what’s good for them and the Brotherhood at large. From now on, every person found to be unemployed or working jobs deemed unimportant to the Brotherhood’s goals will be subject to so-called Emergency Shifts at local mines, factories, power plants, and other areas in crucial need of staff. With the additional manpower, we should see our output improving in no time."
BBW_chop_whatever_you_can_desc: "The amount of coal unearthed in Bełchatów is simply not sufficient to maintain our overstrained power grid. While there are many more deposits beneath the Voivodeship’s soil, setting up new mining operations would prove far too costly given our limited resources and unstable situation. What we do have at our disposal, however, are plenty of working men and a wide array of axes and chainsaws to choose from. The conclusion is simple, of course - our workers, voluntary or not, will be sent to gather as much firewood as possible from the enormous forests spanning the region. While not the most efficient energy source out there, it should be enough to keep the power output stable for the moment, or at least so I’ve been told."
BBW_search_wherever_you_can_desc: "Thus far, the measures we’ve put in place to limit power waste have gone largely unenforced. Sure, there were some particularly egregious incidents that any person with even a smidge of Common Sense would spot, but things aren’t always so easy. Now that the Blackout is mostly a non-issue, it’s high time that we do some weeding and find all those who thought themselves too clever to be caught. Anyone suspected of rigging their electricity usage counters or possessing more fuel than they were allotted will face justice for sabotaging the Brotherhood.\n\nAdditionally, Proctor Janecki suggested that this could also serve as a great way for the Carbonari to prove themselves. Acting as our own eyes and ears on the ground, they’ll get rewarded for reporting anyone they think might be bending the rules.\nThey might end up needing slightly sanitized explanations for what happens to those they turn over, however..."
BBW_voice_of_the_brotherhood_desc: "My booming voice thunders all over the Brotherhood's official broadcasts as all our grateful, loyal citizens turn on their makeshift speakers and radios to hear their leader speak. With a great deal of pride, I declare a remarkable triumph - the hope-draining blackouts have been dealt with, banished only to the people's collective memory of what life would look like without us. The forced corvée servitude, massive deforestation, and emergency shifts were all worth it, as finally, everyone can enjoy power without any interruption. But even though we celebrate today, we still have a long way to go before Common Sense can truly become common."
BBW_protocols_of_atomic_crusade_desc: "I am a prolific writer, a talent I use to its full extent in a noble effort to lay down my truth upon the Brotherhood and expose those who would rather see me fail. It seems it is time to once again use my skills for our collective good. In the 'Protocols of the Atomic Crusade', I shall warn the people of a dangerous Wiechowite conspiracy threatening to destroy everything we have built. I will show everyone its past efforts of infiltrating and overthrowing the Polish government, even pushing the Germans to invade our soil, and I will expose its current preparations for a nuclear-powered crusade and its goal to purge the Brotherhood, Europe, and then the world in atomic hellfire. I will write to get the word out and change the hearts and minds of our citizens. Again, again, and again, until no other truth can even be considered."
BBW_green_faction_desc: "How can we be sure that our people are truly loyal to us? That they won’t stab us in the back at the nearest opportunity? How do we know that they’re not making more bombs in their basements or attics? It’s easy to ignore rogue elements, just smile and wave as we lose more great minds like Sommer. If we don’t take the initiative in our battle against those green bastards, then we’re just inevitably setting ourselves up for failure. I’ll notify Head Paladin Rzymkowski that it’s time again to sweep out any eco-fascists that might be hiding amongst our working population. These traitors will face the only punishment they deserve – death."
BBW_achievements_desc: "The blackouts, the dissidents, the constant threat of totalitarian control... all of that is proof that you just can't create a common-sense society without thoroughly deprogramming the ideological malaise that befell our nation. We stood on the edge of doom, our state dying under blackouts and waves of unrest. And yet, we refused to break. The challenge and the sacrifice only strengthened our resolve. To become masters of infrastructure and industry. To redefine the methods of social control. To affirm the Brotherhood as the last hope for this country and this planet."
BBW_official_initation_of_adepts_desc: "Upon their arrival, our recruits were an undisciplined, disorganized group lacking any real purpose. However, thanks to our rigorous education, and ruthless drills, we have honed the strength of their minds with every scream, every punishment, until they were no longer boys, but men, ready to swear their oaths and stand together with us as warriors of Common Sense. Once the words are spoken, their fate is sealed. We are defined by our choices. Their decision to come here, to utter the oaths, all culminate in the choice to become a part of the Brotherhood. They better make us proud."
BBW_new_brotherhood_spokesman_desc: "As the Brotherhood grows, so too do its needs. Soon, the ever-increasing administrative burden will become too much to handle alone. My focus must remain singular, with no room for miscalculations and disturbances for our greater goals. Therefore, the day-to-day operations of our state will have to be entrusted to my soon-to-be-appointed spokesman. There are only two candidates who remotely fit such a dignified position, and curiously, they both absolutely despise each other. Well, I guess it's time to take sides."
BBW_stabilization_of_energy_grid_desc: "We can no longer tolerate having to shut off power for the majority of the day. Are we some sort of ecofascists to restrict people's access to electricity? No, from now on, our top priority will be the constant expansion of the Bełchatów plant! I don't care what it takes, it must provide for the entire region. Much work has already been done, so it shouldn't be long before we expand its output enough to match the greed of our energy grid."
BBW_a_curious_find_desc: "The city of Łódź, once shrouded in the dark, shines once more. You could see it from miles away, the beautiful glow resulting from Warzecha's efforts and the work of its denizens... had it not been covered by layers of smog. But the faint hue visible behind its dark coating is much fairer on the eyes than its light gleaming through a clear sky. The two-fold sign of progress - carbon dioxide blessing the air and electric power blessing the ground. I can finally relax and commence my flight over the city and relish in the light show below. I shall fly low enough to see all the signs of Łódź's restoration and to ensure the sleepless citizens know I was (and am) above them."
BBW_moment_of_peace_desc: "Our efforts were nothing less than a resounding success. We rose to the occasion and met the challenges of infrastructure, energy, and discontent that broke all the lesser men who came before us. Our calling has been justified and our power has been entrenched. And now, our truth, too, reigns supreme. Thanks to our diligent workers, the factories and power plants reach previously unseen levels of productivity, and the people, shrouded in smog, are finally at peace. Nothing can stop us now, and so I will return to my dacha, where I can resume my grand design for the Brotherhood's future."
BBW_our_inspiration_desc: "We are finally ready to intensify our efforts and strengthen the ties that bind our Brotherhood, and of course, the responsibility for ensuring this falls on me. Ever since our state's foundation, the people who put their trust in us have been threatened by subversive elements and foreign operatives, and I have no doubt that now we must go further than ever before to protect them. Our industrial utopia cannot be achieved if we don't pursue greater unity as a nation. If the Brotherhood is to truly live up to its name, our brothers need to be prepared for the challenges ahead. They look up to me for guidance, and so I too need to be ready, cast all doubt aside, and charm them with visions of our brighter future. Together we will achieve greatness."
BBW_lungs_full_of_hope_desc: "Apparently, Warzecha has just compiled his latest situational report on the state of our economy. But I don't need his ramblings to see that our power has grown several times over. Our investments reach the remotest corners of our territory, turning even the greatest backwaters into full-blown economic powerhouses. The army's fighting strength is increasing exponentially, and new weapons are being invented and put to use. We're developing aviation, education, science, and much more! And on top of all that, industry is booming so hard, all of Europe can hear our hammers and drills! All aspects of life touched by the rejuvenating hand of the Brotherhood are experiencing an unprecedented renaissance. It's good to live in prosperity..."
BBW_factory_scribes_desc: "Advanced production methods require expertise. Sure, we could always throw endless waves of manpower and resources at the problem in the foolish hope that it ends up fixing itself, but without engineers, logisticians, trained chemists, and many other experts, we might end up like those primitive scouts - trying to build an economy with slings and pinecones. We are a sophisticated Brotherhood with plenty of members with enough know-how to train and manage the next generation of industrial experts. They will finally ensure us a worthwhile output."
BBW_tube_terminals_desc: "Globalization and its consequences were truly just a cascade of stupidity and a disaster for all production. A single factory in Belgium, or some third-world hellhole, being an all-or-nothing node in the worldwide semiconductor industry? Such a fragile little thing, this globalist economy. Fortunately for us, we have the know-how and frugality to revert to more manageable vacuum tube computers. They should have more than enough computing power to sustain all our current needs and, more importantly, can be made without imports of any kind. Never again will we be at the mercy of foreign interests."
BBW_initial_start_desc: "We're not moving forward fast enough. Yes, we're on schedule, but the schedule completely underestimated the significance of national developments, let alone international ones. Luckily, I have a plan to counteract this issue - a twelve-hour workday. We'll refunnel as much personnel as possible to construction crews, which will work round the clock on two separate shifts. This way we can accelerate the building of our most vital projects. The workers won't be able to stand it for long, but the measure will only be temporary - just a brief sprint to catch up with the world in the one way that matters."
BBW_private_investitions_desc: "Having created the Brotherhood as the last remaining aegis of Common Sense, it was inevitable that the entrepreneurial spirit within would manifest. With our position solidified, many of our members have now chosen to invest their money in various economic ventures. And among the bloom of private capital, an intriguing new class has taken root - foreign investors. Inspired by our image as ideological pioneers and safe haven for capitalist policies, these daredevil small business owners seek deals in places where few dare tread. Not one to persecute a lemonade stand with a lawbook, I welcome their contribution to our growing economy. My scribes shall take good care of them, seeing what's worth learning and what's worth trading."
BBW_full_speed_production_desc: "Did I say anything about the twelve-hour shifts being temporary? Well, if you claim I did, you are clearly just spreading subversive propaganda and need to be removed. No, we have to make the most of our factories, and since we don't have the manpower to do three shifts of eight hours each, we WILL settle for a 12-hour workday, and we WILL be happy about it! Shorter shifts were warranted when dissenters were banging at our door, but now that my power is unquestioned, the Brotherhood will get its prosperity and YOU WILL NOT COMPLAIN! Do you think I work eight hours a day? Why should you be different?"
BBW_american_licenses_desc: "The progress we’ve made to solidify our presence has allowed us to secure deals never before dreamed of. Thus far, the apparently uncertain internal situation and lack of any international recognition have successfully prevented companies from even daring to open negotiations with us. Supposedly, any kind of monetary investment would prove “too risky” and “bad for their image”. In truth, they're just cowards, afraid of real progress. But now that our victory looms ever closer and our superiority over the other warlords is clear, we've managed to set up talks with representatives of certain decently large American corporations sympathetic to our cause. Though they mostly remain unsure for now, we've managed to procure licenses from a handful of mainly electronics and agricultural enterprises. Hopefully, we could find a way to utilize them in one way or another."
BBW_district_bunkers_desc: "The Wiechowszczyzna - a threat not just from within, but also without. Their grimy, atomic, sludge-ridden tendrils spread far and wide, corrupting everyone to fear, hate and despise us. Though coal's superiority is obvious and unquestionable, we can't just rest on our laurels as those fanatics gather their strength. We need to be ready for their every strike, and so too must our population. After all, what if the worst truly came to pass? Therefore, to ensure the people's safety, I’ve approved an initiative to fortify every major city and regional capital within the Brotherhood with an impressive array of underground bunkers that could save thousands in case of an attack from the brainwashed masses and their Atomic puppetmasters."
BBW_beef_on_the_table_desc: "If there's anything that can be called crucial to the Polish way of life it's the delicious meats from Polish animals. Beef, pork, poultry, mutton... our culture is practically built on the consumption of animal products. It's no surprise that the green forces, hellbent on destroying everything that is traditional, wish to take the greatest source of nutrients away from us. They want to make Poland weak with their 'plant-based diets' and 'vegan lifestyles' - all euphemisms for destroying our society from the inside. No, we will not give in! Our cows will graze on their pastures, on the lands emptied by those too cowardly to breathe real Polish air. Their meat will help create the strong men that will get the Brotherhood through these tough times."
BBW_city_adjustment_desc: "Senior Paladin Gadomski's ideas get weirder and weirder by the day. In our pursuit of new coal veins to feed our constantly growing industry, we have discovered a great deal of resources located below already-inhabited areas. Cities, villages, hell, even single disheveled shacks in the middle of the woods. For now, we've had the comfort to ignore them and simply look elsewhere, but as the pool of untapped coal grows increasingly scarce, well, we have a bit of a problem. According to Gadomski, the best course of action would be to forcefully relocate the citizens of said settlements to the metropolises of Bełchatów and Łódź. Personally, I find this idea ridiculous and headache-inducing just to think about. That’s not even poking a beehive, it’s like smashing it with a sledgehammer while clutching the queen bee!\n\nRegardless, the measure will be put to a vote. I just hope Gadomski knows what he's doing."
BBW_organised_logging_desc: "We cannot hope to achieve sufficient production unless we are ready to make sacrifices - that much is clear. Thanks to the efforts undertaken by me and the council, the Brotherhood is more than ready for these sacrifices, but in order for them to bear fruit, we must somehow achieve greater efficiency. I have no illusions about the problems of our current production - we do not have enough fuel as is, and our methods are not streamlined enough. Mining simply won't suffice on its own, at least for now. We can rely on wood to make up for the deficit, but we have to turn our current procurement efforts into a full-on organized, state-managed system. It's time to get logging."
BBW_energetic_stability_desc: "As an organization focused primarily on generating power and mining operations, the Brotherhood always thoroughly pondered the challenge of restoring the devastated energy grid. Modern mining techniques require significant amounts of power, but even the most efficient grids experience heavy energy losses during transmission. To address this, we have devised a rather ingenious solution. Minor power plants will be assigned to every village and production site, allowing us to fully utilize the generated output and reduce the costs associated with rebuilding the energy grid."
BBW_underground_mine_belchatow_desc: "Some things never change. The situation within the Brotherhood and even more so outside its borders may be ever-fleeting, but one thing always stays the same - we drill wherever there is coal to be found. For every surface deposit, there are many more hidden deep underground. Once surveyed, all that's left to do is use the machinery at our disposal to dig a network of tunnels, with each of these tendrils advancing against rock and stone, siphoning the precious coal right into our grasp."
BBW_district_mine_rogow_desc: "The otherwise unremarkable hamlet of Rogów is about to receive a boost in employment and population that rivals what even a gold rush can provide. Of course, unlike the real thing, our gold has been out of demand for quite a while now due to the cries of industry-hating liberals, but all of that will change. Coal and energy production will inevitably cause home workshops and later dedicated factories to spring up. But what's with all the complaints about our plans overlapping with some kind of local... arboretum? Surely the people will do just fine without their pretentious little trees."
BBW_internal_migration_desc: "With our new investments soon to be up and running, it is time to face the grim and unwanted truth - our grand projects will require some sacrifices to complete. The mines are our greatest source of pride, but obviously, building them will require the... relocation of some unfortunate few. I know this may be difficult for the people of Rogów, Główno, and Rogożno, but they must do their part for the good of the Brotherhood. We will have them move to other cities as we prepare to convert their towns into mining posts. "
BBW_surface_mines_glowno_rogozno_desc: "Ahh, the Głowno-Rogóźno surface mine. Truly a sight to behold. So large that it dwarfs both its namesake towns combined and then some. A neverending maze of man-made hills and stone valleys, all centering around a colossal gaping maw in which uncountable heaps of coal await their extraction. There is so much to be done, so much black gold to dig up. But with enough power and our state-of-the-art machinery, even this mine can eventually be tamed."
BBW_power_of_steel_desc: "Time to plunder the rubble of the Old World! So much industrial glory of Pre-Fall Poland lies dormant as scrap in the nation's junkyards. While others would be content to ignore these mountains of potential treasure, we will show our enemies just how resourceful we can be by reforging the waste into new, powerful weapons. Don't let the cries of the malcontents fool you, our soldiers won't be going into battle with rusty lead pipes as weapons. That is just enemy propaganda, just like the accusations that reusing scrap for production could technically be considered *gulp* recycling."
BBW_machines_of_future_desc: "We're finally ready. Now that the Brotherhood has been supplied with new resources (of rather questionable quality) we can finally start the production of our first line of tanks. That's right, tanks. We'll no longer have an army made purely of poorly-trained footmen, but one that truly lives up to our status of industrial pioneers. Years of practice have allowed us to use all sorts of metals and meld them into proper armored vehicles. Soon all will tremble before our machines of war."
BBW_soldiers_of_future_desc: "While our military projects and machines are indeed impressive, we can't deny that infantry combat remains the bread and butter of all warfare. Our present army may have been enough to crush the pathetic woodland scouts and Jewish hooligans, but against proper militaries? Well, I'd expect them to fare rather poorly. During the wars of regional unification, many units outright refused their orders and fled the battlefield. By no means can that be tolerated. We will ensure the iron discipline of our recruits, even if they have to suffer brutal training regimens to achieve it. This way, we will finally be able to expect greater success of our military operations. If only there was a way to somehow enhance our soldiers' survivability. With all that effort going into preparing them for combat, it'd be a shame to lose them so quickly."
BBW_airships_of_the_future_desc: "Though the ranks of our army have swelled greatly since our Brotherhood's foundation, there is one branch of the military we have thus far neglected - the airforce. While the everpresent smog clouding our skies works wonders when it comes to negating our foes' aerial advantage, we can't rely on the forces of nature forever, lest our troops be blown to smithereens from above. If we're serious about proving our industrial dominance over Poland, we need to develop military airships of our own to ensure us a crucial advantage over all the illegitimate warlords we're bound to face. I'm sure we'll be able to develop something suitable soon."
BBW_cinder_drones_desc: "One of the young engineers just had a brilliant idea. He managed to turn cinder from burned coal into some kind of plastic, and what's more, it's durable and light enough that with the right propeller, it would be able to fly! The lad was well prepared, he even showed me a working prototype. I couldn't believe my eyes as it actually lifted off my desk and effortlessly hovered in the air. The controls left much to be desired, but that's something we can smooth out in later development. We can easily utilize this invention for military purposes in the form of unmanned drones. Besides, we can always tell our doubters that we're doing something for the environment. Technically we are, just not in the way they mean."
BBW_vertibirds_on_prey_desc: "We've already achieved tremendous success with our exploits in the skies. Our drones and fighters cover the sky like an unpenetrable layer of smog, bringing terror from above. And soon, they will have even more aerial company. The 'Vertibird' project nears completion, and soon, we will be ready to begin the mass production of flying vehicles capable of airlifting troops and engaging in air-to-air combat. All of that while being fueled solely by coal. I can almost see the first test flight! Oh, it will be glorious!"
BBW_terror_of_the_skies_desc: "The sky is ours!\n\nShort of somehow weaponizing smog, we have all the means we could ever hope for when it comes to dispatching our enemies from the air. We will bomb their houses, factories, and railways, destroying all their infrastructure until nothing remains but white flags. But now that the smaller airships are fully operational, it's time to turn toward grander projects. Armored blimps! Imagine these beasts of terror above our enemies' skies - the purest exemplification of our might and dominance. The mere sight of these behemoths towering over the impoverished lands of our rivals will be enough to cast fear into their eyes and remind them of their rightful place. In the air, as on land, the Brotherhood will be unmatched!"
BBW_need_desc: "First of all, we never intended to build coal-fuelled power armor suits. Their presence on our posters is merely a matter of artistic license, a profound personification of our noble struggle. To suggest we would actually attempt to implement this idealistic fiction would be pure slander!   Have people forgotten that the Brotherhood is all about common sense? Following it necessitates sticking to tried and tested, reliable armor designs. After all, only by intensively drilling our men according to the doctrines of maneuver panzer warfare will we be able to defeat our numerous foes."
BBW_necessity_desc: "While we don't yet have the means to equip our soldiers with sophisticated armor (despite the constant pleas of our most dedicated members to immediately start the development of power armor technology), the idea that each and every Paladin should be akin to a tank in their fighting capabilities and prowess is most tempting. Like an isolated tank, so too will our soldiers be deadly and unstoppable, even when alone. They shall bear the standard of progress and from it, draw the inner strength and resolve to triumph over our foes."
BBW_fast_is_good_desc: "Our mission is still far from completion, leaving us with only limited resources. Therefore, we must think twice before we dedicate ourselves to building truly impressive machines, especially main battle tanks. I have tried working it into our budget, but the plans will have to be put off, at least for now. I hope that one day we may dust them off and turn them into reality, but for now, we must improvise, we must adapt, and we must overcome. And it seems to me that this can only be achieved through the mass production of lighter armored vehicles. They are much faster than tanks, and more importantly, much cheaper. This will allow us to reinforce our cause with state-of-the-art armored warfare without losing all of our funds on costly, sluggish tanks."
BBW_harder_is_better_desc: "As the Brotherhood's leading figure, I am responsible for protecting my people. In the face of a severe threat from neighboring warlords, we cannot hold back when it comes to strengthening our military might. When riding into battle, our brave soldiers must be accompanied by awe-inspiring steel beasts. I didn't have to think long when it comes to finding the best candidate to fill this role. Only one vehicle stands above all others as the king of mobile warfare - the heavy tank. Ever since World War 2 it has been the deciding factor of many-a-battle, always striking fear into the hearts of those in its way. The production of these killer machines will cost us greatly, but it is something necessary for us to succeed. We cannot compromise on our path forward. Our military must be the strongest in Poland."
BBW_paladin_tomasz_sommer_zpw_desc: "Dedication. Strength. Sacrifice. These three virtues of the Brotherhood are exemplified perfectly in the figure of the late Head Paladin Tomasz Sommer. It is our duty to honor him, and in doing so, encourage the rest of us to reach his heights. Though our budget remains strapped, it just so happens that we can afford the construction of a much-needed small arms factory. Every rifle forged inside it shall bear his name and discharge the Brotherhood's justice exactly the way our hero would have willed."
BBW_rapid_responding_desc: "Opting for speed, we have to inevitably sacrifice some firepower, but with careful balancing, even that will be no issue. If we create rapid units that still pack a considerable punch, we'll be able to respond to enemy infantry assaults with a hailstorm of bullets and highly explosive, destructive rounds. Some might say that we're forgetting to provide them with sufficient armored and artillery support, but the sheer speed of our units will ensure it isn't even needed in the first place. Our combat vehicles will simply overrun and encircle hostile tanks, cutting off their supply and forcing them to surrender."
BBW_first_contact_forces_desc: "Thus far, our forces have often been too slow to adequately react to enemy raids and frontline assaults, only showing up after the damage had already been done and our foes have retreated back to their positions. I will put an end to this. By providing trucks for our rapid response units, we'll be able to get our soldiers into battle as soon as we get the signal to intervene. This way, we'll reduce the time required to deploy our troops to nearly a quarter of what we could achieve beforehand, allowing us to adequately defend our cause and turn our enemies into pavement for our vehicles to drive on."
BBW_cham21_desc: "Artillery is often regarded as the cruel God of War, as every reputable strategy handbook will remind you. And when it comes to explosive shells, the rule is - the bigger the better. Why pelt the enemy with tiny pellets when we can blast them into oblivion with one giant shell? For this exact purpose, we have created the colossal Saint Barbara cannon, an awe-inspiring tube of steel boasting a caliber of nearly an entire meter. Now, our enemies will tremble in fear even when hidden behind their fortifications, while the sight of this behemoth will inspire our troops and engineers alike."
BBW_zgred37_desc: "Tanks have always raced to become tougher and stronger. The Ukraine War showcased the unmatched power of American tanks, which consistently defeated their faster, but less armored Russian counterparts. Our industrial ingenuity can be expected to deliver nothing but the hardest armor and most powerful arms. The Koala tank will exemplify this perfectly. How thick must the armor be? Thicker. How many cannons? Yes. Finding a suitable engine for this beast? Eh, I leave that for my engineers to figure out, that's why they're called engineers after all. Can it stand up to modern anti-tank rocketry? Well, our enemies couldn't possibly hope to get their hands on any, so it doesn't even matter."
BBW_armored_roller_grace_desc: "A disciplined, well-commanded battlegroup is like an orchestra and a ballet combined. With all the grace of nearly hundred-ton machines and the subtlety of a 50cm cannonade, we shall turn the battlefield into our own symphony. Our speed and organization will be so impeccable that the enemy will have no choice but to break and kneel in applause before our violins, bass, guns, and cannons. We shall dance an armored waltz around them, and as the earth thunders, they will bow before us with minimal resistance."
BBW_modern_plating_desc: "As disappointing as it may sound to the dreamers within our ranks, I've made the decision to keep our efforts at improving our armor technology within the boundaries of modern conventions. While the idea of sending our soldiers into battle clad in mighty power armor may be tempting, the risk of it all going wrong is too high and the costs of actually researching and developing such a project are too heavy. We have enough funds and industry to simply outclass our rivals as it is, and if exploring new frontiers can doom us, we're better off not chasing impossible dreams. After all, if we are to stay true to our cause of defending Common Sense and being the much-needed voice of reason, we cannot bet everything on wishful thinking and fantasies."
BBW_dissemination_of_bulletproof_vests_desc: "While our manufacturing efforts have certainly been expensive, the most valuable resource out there is still manpower. As such, we need to focus on preventing as many casualties as possible before we even think about cutting our spending on procurement and production. The bulletproof vest is already a commonly used piece of equipment, and although it won’t always save a life, it can do a lot to protect a soldier’s vitals. An experienced combattant knows when he can afford to take a risk, so being equipped with a vest will greatly aid him in his efforts. If we want a professional army, we must be ready to provide our men with the equipment they need to demonstrate their full prowess on the battlefield."
BBW_most_modern_plating_desc: "The time has come for some true innovation. Many have doubted us. Even our brothers said it can't be done. They claimed it couldn't possibly work, that the cost would be too great to be worth the risk. But they're all wrong. What they fail to see is that ordinary armor technology is a limitation – one that we cannot accept if we are to remain on our road to progress. Instead, we'll craft a masterpiece of engineering that will force our enemies to respect and fear us - the Brotherhood's first generation of power armor. No matter how much we have to spend, the investment will be worth it in the end. If our fight is to result in victory, we must go beyond what is thought to be possible and reach out toward greatness."
BBW_contracts_of_our_dreams_desc: "Today, I have officially signed the contracts to begin the production of power armor for our soldiers! Our most loyal unit of paladins will be moved on-site to assist the scientists, providing them with feedback on battlefield functionality, and will be bestowed the honor of being the first unit to test our new weapons of the future! I spoke with a few of them, and they are almost as excited as I am, maybe even more so, as they will be directly interacting with this technology. I don't have the time to sit with them in some stuffy production facility, but I can already imagine those military parades...\nMight, clad in steel, marching on!"
BBW_knights_of_progress_desc: "Over time, I’ve started to notice a change in the attitude of our junior members. The idea of donning a suit of armor and charging into battle to fight for common sense appeals to the young adepts more than ever. I hope this is a result of something more than just being swayed by propaganda. It seems possible, probable even, that they truly believe in the innovative warfare we seek to promote. This sentiment will undoubtedly lead to a rise in their morale - something we so greatly desire. After all, it is one of the few things that cannot be achieved even with sufficient profit and enough R&D work."
BBW_full_success_desc: "The measure of a civilization's power is how much it can influence the fate of the world. Through our might, ingenuity, and forward thinking we have achieved the impossible. Thanks to us, war has changed. Our power armor project will forever alter the face of the battlefield. We will depart from the Bolshevik model of thoughtlessly sending untrained masses of people to their deaths and instead focus on the individual warrior who alone will be able to overcome vastly superior enemy forces through the sheer power of his will, enabled by futuristic technology. This is the dawn of a new industrial revolution, and we will be its herald. With this armor, we force the eyes of the skeptics open. Look - we say - this is ours, made by us, and this is not our final word. We're just getting started!"
BBW_moderate_success_desc: "Well, things didn't turn out exactly as we planned. Instead of Iron Men, all we have is one big irony. Yes, perhaps our dreams were nothing but science fiction, but ambition is still something to be desired. Without it, the Brotherhood would have never gotten to where it is now, so what if we failed this one time? Plus, not everything is lost! After all, we gained a lot of valuable experience which could be applied in the development of future military projects. Nothing should go to waste! This is just another lesson to draw conclusions from.\n\nI even have a few ideas lined up already, I just can't find the disgraced engineers anywhere... Maybe Łukasz will know more!"
BBW_alternative_application_desc: "I found them! And it even seems like they had the same idea as I did because from what I learned, they are already awaiting further orders in a mine near Bełchatów! So, where was I? Ah yes, so - a miner can lift only a limited amount of excavated resources, but with an exoskeleton, they would be able to work more efficiently, dig harder, and carry more! And if we were to also install a drill as part of the armor... I'm not exactly well-versed in the technicalities, but since we can't use our inventions in combat, let's at least try to support our industry by bringing it into the 21st, nay, 22nd century and permanently redefining the image of a miner from a menial workman into that a one-man powerhouse carrying the nation's prosperity on his back!"
BBW_internal_peace_desc: "I've always believed in victory, but now it seems the measure of our success is greater than even I expected it to be. In our zealous fight against the climate hoax and the stubborn resistance of its believers, we have finally achieved stability. The majority of dissidents have either been made irrelevant, silenced, or... disposed of. But that’s not the only thing we’ve achieved. I’m proud to say we have finally managed to bring the flow of information under our control. It is no longer disrupted by those seeking to undermine our work and ideological nay-sayers, the green league is a distant memory, and we are firmly on the road to complete success. Oh, how wonderful it is – I can already imagine what the world will be like after we complete our mission. I won’t let anyone stop me, because we are not stopping now."
BBW_press_freedom_institute_desc: "Too many media outlets in Poland have been poisoned with falsehoods inspired by the great climate panic. All across the country people are “independently” segregating their waste, driving electric cars, advocating for the closure of coal mines, and other such nonsense. But not here. We believe in the power of coal, traditional energy, and the good old way of life. And I fully intend to keep it that way, starting with the newspapers. To free our press from corruption, we need to establish an institute to ensure its 'freedom'. It will monitor all journalists operating on our territory and make sure none of them ever dares to spread climatist lies. Janecki can handle the job. I know he’d be willing to take all action to guarantee that available sources of information stick to reporting the truth, and only the truth."
BBW_climatology_institute_desc: "The so-called climatologists have been a constant and impossible-to-ignore thorn in our side for a long time now. We can continue to defend ourselves by silencing their alluring voices and shielding the populace from their lies, but that can only get us so far. I believe it’s high time to start our counter-attack. Therefore, I have decided to sponsor the creation of a climatology institute of our own. Under my name, of course. It will provide our curious citizens with all the knowledge on the topic they will ever need. Obviously, the reports will primarily be based on my own work and research, making them quite different from those published by other such institutes, but that is precisely what we need – an alternative to all the eco-terrorist whining."
BBW_brotherhood_u_desc: "Our efforts remain focused on the future, and in order to not undermine them, we must not neglect proper education. Industry is still the top priority, but we should at least provide some specialized classes to keep our society cultured and intelligent, as opposed to the savages still living among the undeveloped ruins of old Poland. The founding of an official Brotherhood University with branches in Łódź and Bełchatów is the first step towards building an enlightened nation. Our respected senior members can act as lecturers in these schools and prepare our younger generations for becoming the future elite of this country. At first, the self-styled intellectuals will scoff at our noble university, but in time it will become a prestigious institution like no other, and they will not be laughing then."
BBW_one_paper_desc: "For a long time now, I've had a feeling that we aren't truly utilizing the potential of the 'Do Rzeczy' newspaper. Though it lies firmly under our control and we've already used it many times to spread our truth to the wider public, there's always been a crucial piece missing - a leading figure to truly turn the paper into a propaganda machine. Luckily, I know just the right man for the job. If we can get Paweł Lisicki back at the helm, 'Do Rzeczy' can once again return to its highest standards of journalistic quality and ideological purity. If there is anyone whom I can trust to dutifully and expertly redact the sole newspaper of our blossoming society, it's him. Surely he won't have to think twice before accepting our offer."
BBW_semblance_of_discussion_desc: "If we want to enjoy a greater deal of popular support, we have to make sure our citizens don't lose trust in the government. And if we can prove that our officials are capable of engaging in a peaceful debate – and winning it, of course - we will surely be more trusted. I believe it would be a perfect opportunity if Warzecha were to prove his rhetorical skill by disproving some climatist arguments in a public broadcast. I have complete faith in his abilities, but the plan does come with a lot of issues. Firstly, our unrelenting crackdown on the atomic crusade and other eco-terrorists makes it difficult to find any dissident actually willing to cooperate and sit down with us. Furthermore, we can't afford of single slip-up in a live televised debate, and mistakes do happen, even to the best of us. As such, we will need to get creative and conjure up some opponents for our champion, even if that requires enlisting some actors and a bit of off-screen scriptwriting. That way we can send the right message without risking a potential failure."
BBW_one_vision_desc: "My books already form an important part of the Brotherhood's culture, greatly influencing the views of our people. In many ways, they are true national epics and treasure troves of philosophy from which everyone can draw values and beliefs. And now, we finally have a newspaper that keeps the common folk informed and reminds them of our glory. With such wealth of Common Sense material, I keep asking myself - why would we have them read anything else? I have learned my lessons from our humble beginnings and clashes with eco-fanatics. Without government sanction, literature always carries the risk of poisoning people's minds with propaganda and vile lies aiming to discredit the carbon cause. We can't allow that to happen. My books and Do Rzeczy will be the sole guiding lights in the ideological sphere of the Brotherhood."
BBW_full_shafts_desc: "Our recent debates between Warzecha and his 'adversaries' has led me to a rather concerning realization. There is still a surprisingly large opposition to our government's policies within the country. They hide in the shadows and avoid any contact with our institutions and peacekeepers, fully aware of our lack of tolerance for their rotten beliefs. But if we are to remain a strong and unified society, we must pull those weeds out at every opportunity, not just wait for them to grow too large to be ignored. We will hunt down all enemies of the state, and make sure they are never heard from again! It will be a massive undertaking and I have no clue just how many dissidents we'll find, but I'm sure the mining shafts will serve as perfect grounds for their mass burials. Hopefully, they don't overfill."
BBW_regionalisation_of_brotherhood_desc: "Ahh, as predicted, constant success and back-to-back triumph. Our territories multiply in mere months, and our efforts at integrating new conquests have to somehow keep up. No longer capable of maintaining the Brotherhood as a hyper-unitary organization, we must develop a regional division of government, capable of being replicated across every voivodeship to control the new lands and bind them to my will. Additionally, these divisions will also be responsible for recruitment, ensuring that new blood keeps flowing in the Brotherhood's veins. With Warzecha's no-nonsense methods and my meticulousness, our regional chapters will soon run like clockwork."
BBW_even_angry_desc: "Alea iacta est - the die has been cast. I wish I didn't have to do this, but we just don't have any other choice. We're out of manpower, and with each new region conquered, the problem only gets worse. No matter how many recruits the Common Sense Academy churns out, we're down to staffing our administration with halfwits - loyal but incapable of a single independent thought. To combat this, I've delegated Roxi to initiate some people Warzecha and I would consider... untrustworthy. In other words - revisionists. The thought of hearing their twisted arguments and calling them my brothers sickens me, but if it means not having to worry about how few recruits we are getting, so be it"
BBW_most_obedient_desc: "Regrettably, we've been forced to open our doors to people our members can't quite vouch to be... reasonable. Luckily, there is nothing that the Common Sense Academy can't fix: We will streamline its curriculum to be even more intense and pervasive, assuring the obedience and ideological integrity of all future graduates. The professors can whine all they want about the "quality of education," but we just can't let a single future rebel slip through the cracks. And sure, we did have to thin down our engineering and research departments to deliver more expert-level minds for the academy, but the growth of our movement will make it all worth it."
BBW_adaptation_of_factories_desc: "Typically, before opening, every new factory must first be exalted - augmented to be as energy-consuming and potent as possible, assuring the quality of its production at the expense of increased power requirements and wasted materials. But, our conquests mean that we simply can't keep up with such upgrades, especially on newly-subjugated territory. However, we can't let issues like energy shortages and material shortfalls influence our policy, not ever again. And so, as any good boss would tell his employees - we must make do with less. Moving forward, that will be the course of action for most of our factories."
BBW_humility_desc: "We haven't even finished fully initiating the new members, and already our mess halls and corridors are contaminated with poisonous revisionism. A worry about how long our ores will last here, a fear there, fear, fear everywhere, all disguised as humility! A single misstep, a single instance of relenting on our ideals, and immediately it cascades into abandoning common sense! At the heart of it all, Roxi sits, trying my patience, holding her little lectures in the underbellies of our lands, as if I'm not listening..."
BBW_full_remodeling_desc: "Now that the education of our new recruits is once more proceeding smoothly, we can relegate our most ideologically sound personnel to adapt our new factories to conform to our standards. Standards of consumption. We must never be concerned with weak-minded concepts like avoiding excess waste. If anything, the growing piles of refuse are just a symbol of our success. After all, no expense can be spared in the holy task of production. And every new factory needs a supervisor that understands it in the same exact way that I do."
BBW_pride_desc: "This 'Roxi' has been a thorn in our side for far too long now. Not a single doubt, not a single seed of heresy or fear can be allowed to spread. And she, alas, is at an epicenter of all this weakness. Fear denies faith, which in turn denies our momentum. And without momentum, the Brotherhood is nothing. But soon, by my command and Warzecha's act, it shall be Roxi instead that will turn to nothing. Anytime she holds her little lectures, I want an incident. A fight, ventilation breakdown, I don't care. Just silence her. And anyone else who doubts, fears, or otherwise slows us down."
BBW_future_or_fall_desc: "My Brotherhood, my newspaper, all that is mine... none of this was meant as a debate club. But apparently arguing is all we do here now. If these shouting matches, these fights, this *revisionism* can even deserve to be called debates! I would put a swift end to this crisis, if not for the disorder spreading in the countryside. We're receiving reports of an impending economic breakdown. I don't remember the exact issue, but I know why this is happening. The Brotherhood is like an engine. It needs dedication as fuel and certainty as oxidizer to keep the combustion that drives us to progress going. With doubt festering, no wonder the whole machine breaks down! We have two choices - ride forward into the future, or fall by stalling in place. There is no middle ground."
BBW_impulse_desc: "I remember the days when our Brotherhood shook under the blackout. The situation was arguably worse than it is today, yet back then, we were together - confident and obedient. With my guidance, we rose to the occasion and forged an unsurpassed power grid that adequately supplies us to this day. But now it's gone too far. We're too fearful, too weak. The more we doubt, the less we act, the more we argue, the worse everything gets. We need an impulse. Like a slap to the face that ends all dissent and discussion once and for all. But good luck slapping sense into the entire Brotherhood at once..."
BBW_overcrowded_hospitals_desc: "Our hospitals are overfilling with the sick. Everyone reports respiratory issues, and the doctors actually believe them! Have doubts in our ideals really seeped this far into our populace? Some physicians even have the audacity to claim that air pollution is at fault! Hah! This is worse than Roxi. It has to be some ploy manufactured by the damn Atomic Crusade. It's clear as day they brought back the Covid scare, maybe even released the virus itself into the air! I should purge the whole healthcare system, but even I am infected. Not with any illness... with doubt. I saw the ash-covered dead in the hospitals. I oversaw their autopsies. Not once did the bodies have any trace of the virus..."
BBW_insecurity_desc: "It seems we're back in the 1980s! The shelves in our markets are empty. My best men shook up the farmers; demanded answers for their insubordination. But they did not resist, instead swarming the paladins with reports of sickly livestock and crop failures. They dared not tell me the reason for them, instead half-heartedly promising to do better. A small victory in a sea of defeats, but can they be trusted? At least they still believe in our system, something that can't be said about most of their compatriots. As if stuck in some trance, thousands have abandoned their homes in a great trek across our lands. Where are they going? What are they searching for? And don't they know that it's just as bad everywhere else?"
BBW_exodus_desc: "Everything has its cost. Our efforts to set up as many mines as possible to fuel the forges of our conquest have cost us a new wave of internal refugees. While we encouraged as many of them as possible to stay and strip the earth in search of more coal, it turns out the shafts can't fit nearly as many people as a town can. Because of that, flocks of people have started to wander our lands, carrying all they can in their cars or on their backs. Most head for Łódź, where they aim to start new lives, searching for job opportunities and a better hope for their children. However, the city wasn't even remotely prepared for such a large influx of new residents, leading to the emergence of a sprawling network of slums, plagued by poverty, disease, and crime."
BBW_desperation_desc: "You'd think that after reading all of my books and listening to my lectures, people would finally understand our struggle. And they did, but only when the times were good, the economy was booming and resources were plentiful. But during our little, temporary crisis all hell broke loose. I just can't count on anyone these days. The workers are stealing from their factories, skipping their duties, somehow even the paladins are no exception! How am I supposed to fix anything when everyone is just looking out for themselves and refusing to cooperate with us? I can only hope they'll come to their senses after things smooth out. I've dealt with crises before. This is no different."
BBW_bunkers_adaptation_desc: "Necessity is the mother of all invention. As our territory expanded outward into ever further corners of Poland, numerous abandoned bunkers have been left behind on the former frontlines - wild relics of our conquests amongst the tamed terrain. With just a little bit of entrepreneurship, they could serve as an ideal substitute for cheap housing, mainly for refugees relocated from regions impacted by industrial investments. We'll paint the walls, clean the rooms, fix the plumbing and they will be truly cozy. Well, at least cozy enough for the homeless desperates. Besides, it's perfectly safe! Certainly safer than having people wander aimlessly across the country, engaging in various forms of criminal activity."
BBW_tightening_the_belt_desc: "Societal hedonism caused by the demons of late Western capitalism continues to reap its toll among our fellow countrymen. Blinded by their debauchery, they refuse to accept the reality that sometimes there might simply have to be shortages. They'd wish to hoard supplies and wealth while their brothers starve in the streets. To curtail their selfish folly, rationing needs to be introduced in certain departments, especially for essential goods such as food, energy, and even toilet paper, as some have taken to burning it to heat themselves. If we are to extract anything useful from the former communist regime, it has to be the rational approach to the availability of goods and long-term planning for a potential crisis. Of course, nothing bad will happen, but it's always wise to be prepared."
BBW_doctors_without_borders_desc: "All around, everyone is constantly coughing. Even our most loyal doctors can't pinpoint the cause. In fact, they dare not name any culprit that could be responsible for health troubles at all. Worse yet, word has gotten out about this catastrophe, and so a decision was reached to make the most of the negative attention. The 'Doctors Without Borders' are arriving in our territory, whether we wish to welcome them or not. Inevitably, we have to explain to them not so much the symptoms, as they found it quite simple to come to their misguided diagnoses, but rather the sheer scale of the problem. I saw a few of them. Every single one had that stupid, flabbergasted look on their face. Masks covered their mouths, but I knew they were agape. Like they never saw a common-sense society. Or, like they never saw a health crisis of such magnitude..."
BBW_optimization_desc: "Our lifestyle is meant not just for us, but for our children and their children too. One day we'll leave this world, but our descendants will inherit Poland as we left it. To that end, we made the difficult decision to conservatively limit our coal consumption. It seems heretical, but having come from our most influential ideologues, it merely recognizes the invaluable role coal plays in sustaining our way of life. We cannot afford to deplete this precious resource, for it is the lifeblood of our cherished lifestyle. There is a glimmer of optimism in this choice, a ray of hope that we offer to our people. By ensuring the longevity of our coal reserves, we provide a sense of reassurance to our citizens, guaranteeing their well-being for many years to come."
BBW_efficiency_farming_desc: "We have found a place for refugees to make themselves useful - a new type of farm. They're rather small and unremarkable, but will ultimately be our solution to the gnawing issues of starvation. Privately owned, they do stand in open defiance to many founding tenets of our ideology, but we're at a point where utility and results must take precedence. What they lack in size, they make for doubly in output - all assured by the copious application of fertilizers. This should help us kill two birds with one stone, as the very same masses who'd otherwise revolt due to prolonged resource shortages will now be the ones putting an end to them. Quite ingenious if you ask me."
BBW_new_ideas_desc: "Change is always risky. Uncontrolled, it could bring about the destruction of all established norms and principles. Its most powerful expression is a revolution, which is nothing more than a radical form of change. A positive change? We've had that before, it's a rare breed, only accomplished once through our rise to power. Usually, it just results in our country being torn to pieces. Sometimes, a lot needs to change so that everything stays the same.\n\nBut no matter which direction we take, what matters most is an influx of new ideas that will save us from stagnation. Because from stagnation, it's not that far to decadence. And I don't think this country could survive another Fall."
BBW_show_trials_desc: "I can't believe I actually lost my power! All those years of hard work! Putting up with all this bullshit! Bringing the madmen of Łódź down to their knees! I established this damn order! And now this bunch of sperm-brains chooses a good-for-nothing former pop star instead? And why? Because of her name?! Fucking ridiculous! The heads of those traitors are going to roll! It's unbelievable!\nOkay... Breathe in, Rafał. At least I know there are some who are guaranteed to support me. Gadomski will betray me at the first possible moment, Janecki is an enigma, but Warzecha and Rzymkowski have always been steadfast in their ideals. Unless that girly is ready to make up some nonsense accusation against them. But I doubt she's smart enough to do that. Even if she was, where is she going to find any replacements? She's bound to make some stupid mistake and they will beg me to return. When I do, I will make sure to punish everyone responsible for this mess."
BBW_insubordination_desc: "She's more determined than I thought. Subduing my whole cabinet in one fell swoop, getting rid of my greatest ally... it was a cunning stroke of genius I didn't know she was even remotely capable of. No matter, she was foolish enough to leave Rzymowski free. If she continues to sideline our most devoted member, then the Head Paladin will surely launch a full-scale rebellion. While I was ousted in disgrace, he's still quite popular, especially among the military. Maybe not all hope is lost. Perhaps the true teachings will prevail and we'll return to the path toward prosperity. My heart aches as I see my dear order ripped apart by internal struggle. But not for long. Soon I'll reclaim my rightful position."
BBW_accelerated_training_desc: "It's all going according to plan. Rzymkowski will soon rebel if things keep going the way they are now. Roxi keeps throwing all of our hard work down the drain. And while she may deceive the uninformed public, we're well aware of the army's ideological purity and its dedication to the carbon cause. Yet she wishes to uproot it all by recruiting anybody who comes along as long as they reject our one true vision. She wants to flood our ranks with people with no values. People who are easier to control. And for what? 'Focusing on combat effectiveness' is just a buzzword. What worth is it when the soldiers have no greater goal to fight for?"
BBW_curbed_lawlessness_desc: "Roksana's recent exploits are a perfect example of how noble slogans can mask one's devious acts. It's true, the Brotherhood has faced some... problems with corruption among our ranks, but that's no excuse to purge the most devoted members of the old guard. How does she plan to run a state without any reliable bureaucratic cadres? I tell you, it's a matter of time before she comes after me! Not that I'm afraid. Just cautious. I'm surrounded by traitors. Rats, like Gadomski. My former brothers think that if they bow before their new mistress they'll be allowed to survive. I know, nay, I hope they'll be next on the chopping block. Those short-sighted idiots..."
BBW_quick_impressment_desc: "What did I say? As the final part of her most immediate reforms, Roksana Węgiel made the move to appoint many of her newly recruited yes-men as officers, effectively demoting or sidelining the old guard. This can only lead to chaos. It will pretty much destroy any remaining ideological purity within our army. It looks like I can say goodbye to the prospect of returning to power. We're doomed to have Roksanka as our new leader. I hope it was worth it, Gadomski, Janecki, my dear brothers. We were this close to greatness. You ruined it all, now you'll forever have to bear the burden of living in this hellscape you're helping to create."
BBW_new_housing_desc: "I can't believe it. Janecki came to me today with a secret report he supposedly obtained from some black market informant of his. It contained instructions on how to obtain bricks... from smog. Yes. Bricks made from smog. The original recipe apparently came from China, and they ran countless of tests, it’s all legit! A building material that incorporates a resource as fundamental as fresh air. We've been told so many times that smog is evil! But on its shoulders, we will build a new Poland! Monuments erected using this ingenious invention will be more enduring than those made of brass! Our legacy will last for thousands of years! Although I might be getting carried away. We need to discuss this, whether it's morally right..."
BBW_further_resettlements_desc: "The constant pursuit of perfection requires increasingly profound sacrifices. As resources grow scarcer, to maintain our production, we must take control of ever larger tracts of land. Inevitably, the areas that still harbor natural riches often still have people residing in them. Those were at times the only spots we've left untouched. Regrettably, we no longer have that comfort. The ideological imperative demands they yield to us and make their lands available for development. Consequently, it will be necessary to forcibly move an ever-growing number of individuals, whether to cities or temporary relocation camps. Not everyone leaves their home and abandons their possessions voluntarily, which forces our enforcers to employ all permissible means of coercion. Sad, yet necessary."
BBW_maximization_of_processing_desc: "In my time, people were grateful to have a job, dedicating their lives to any workplace that would accept them. Nowadays, we have an abundance of work! This is a sign of our development – that we are capable of reaching far beyond norms and expectations. Every one of our employees should understand that he not only can but must work beyond merely what is required of him. The workplace is a second home, and therefore, we must transform it into such, so that there's no need to waste time commuting back home. Our workers will wake up, spend their day and go to sleep, all within the confines of their factory. They will be able to take advantage of the on-site facilities to achieve the expected high standard. Still, you know, only one can earn the title of the Hero of Labor. Seize it!"
BBW_insight_on_the_market_desc: "We have a clear surplus of produced energy compared to what we can reasonably consume. So why not invest it in international trade? I'm sure we can secure some pretty favorable deals. After all, Europe is engulfed in a crisis, and like Prometheus, we shall bring it light. And to our Polish rivals, I think we can sell some energy too, for... the right price. Perhaps a county or two. Though energy blackmail has a rather bad reputation around these parts for being extensively used by our eastern "neighbors" to control us, it can't be denied - it is quite effective."
BBW_black_market_desc: "I could have expected this. The rotten Western elites lack the guts to accept us as an equal energy partner. No wonder, considering the success of the Wiechowite propaganda there. Starved of other options, we will have to turn to third-world countries, where sound reasoning still guides economic planning. My only concern is that the list of nations willing to entertain our proposal might quickly narrow down drastically to rather peculiar territories, fellow diplomatic pariahs, just like us. But alas, beggars can't be choosers."
BBW_fresh_opening_desc: "Traitors, revisionists, fifth columnists! If they want to wipe us out root and stem why don't they just go ahead and kill me? One single miscalculation, one single misstep and suddenly all of my soldiers abandon their posts and turn on me, on the Brotherhood, on common sense! I was the first to run for my life, the others weren't so lucky. Some got 'retired', others 'disappeared'. All while the last few units of my loyal paladins keep getting neutralized one by one. The great nation I spent years building is crumbling without my guidance. Soon, it will return to dust. As for me, all that is left... is to hide. Find somewhere safe and slowly lose my mind, just as the Brotherhood slowly loses its."
BBW_clean_farming_zones_desc: "Not a moment has passed since the revisionists made themselves comfortable, and already the most heretical strains of thinking have prevailed. The insane notion that the sacred factory exhausts are harmful to nature (or that it should even matter if they are) gives its first rotten fruits: Relocating industries away from agricultural centers to supposedly improve soil quality and restore crop yields. Are they really this daft?! What happened to just throwing more phosphorus at the ground?!! Oh, they'll come crawling back to me once the last few productive farms turn barren because of their incompetence."
BBW_strategic_diversification_desc: "Now, I have to admit, even in my mind, the matter of one day running out of coal lingered. I tried dispelling that heresy, but the concern is valid. After all, the supply of coal is limited - something we can't avoid no matter how deep we dig. In fact, I even had scientists investigate methods to circumvent that problem, and it seems Roxi got wind of their existence and put the team to use. How their efforts will pan out... and whether anything will remain of my Brotherhood once they're done... I don't know. I don't care. Just please, let me rest. I can't keep watching on as my legacy burns."
BBW_biogas_is_also_coal_desc: "Biogas generators. Biogas generators! BIOGAS! They are actually telling themselves that biogas is coal! Well, explain one thing to me, Roxi: If THAT counts as coal, then what doesn't? There are more materials containing carbon than those that don't. We are made of carbon for God's sake! That's right, YOU count as coal. What's next, eh? Burning people as an energy source? If this madness goes on, I'm sure that's what they'll end up doing. Biogas. Well, at least you can't run out of it. There's a method to the madness there... but it's still just guided by fear and revisionism."
BBW_filters_for_power_plants_desc: "As expected of revisionist filth, Roxi once more stands in the way of true progress and everything I've created. Using filters to curtail our divine power plants, greatly reducing their output instead of letting the carbon they produce enshroud us. It makes me go insane how someone who knows so little about the economy can lead my great Brotherhood. But one thing truly makes me wonder. The few contacts I managed to keep all swear that each day, the hospitals receive fewer and fewer patients, all without instituting any epidemiological precautions. Perhaps I should really reconsider what actually happened to our lungs."
BBW_sewage_relocations_desc: "Sewage. It belongs in the rivers, through which it shall be washed away, diluted in the waters of the Baltic Sea. Such is the natural way of life, but apparently, Roxi had another crazy idea of hers that will flip everything on its face. She plans to build treatment facilities to supposedly 'remove the contaminants and purify the water'. It's pure insanity! What's wrong with the water being a little darker? If anything, the industrial remains add to the taste. What is this heresy? We're wasting millions on ecofascist projects, the same kind I've spent my entire reign trying to destroy. I can no longer recognize my Brotherhood. I skulk in the shadows, seeking refuge from the chaos that ensnares it. In this solitude, I can't help but feel my sanity slip away, mirroring the Brotherhood's descent into madness."
BBW_return_from_exile_desc: "Roxi, in her misguided idiocy just had the gall not only to rehabilitate the Wiechowites but formally invite their rotten, corrupt leader to return to the Brotherhood! While I, the founder of this damn nation have to hide in exile, this bastard dares to proudly stroll through Bełchatów as one of her highest ministers? What the hell was Roksana thinking? Wiech is just a parasite, a disease destroying Poland from the inside and she fails to see the obvious danger? This has to be some elaborate joke, a vicious mockery. Or perhaps she was no longer satisfied with merely tainting the Brotherhood with her own ideas. Now she aims to infect us with Wiech's treachery. I can't bear to witness this complete deterioration of our once-proud organization. All hope is lost. No more. Let me rest. Let me forget. This was a good life. It's better to die with your ideals than live having forsaken them all."
BBW_consumption_reduction_desc: "Under the deceptive guise of cost savings, Roxi has embarked on a crusade of reducing power usage and overall consumption, especially when it comes to heating - a grievous departure from the very essence of the Brotherhood's creed. Was it really this easy to forget and abandon common sense? Our way of life has always been defined by the unyielding, unwavering commitment to keeping the fires of industry burning bright. Those flames are now being extinguished. It sickens me. Our sacred tenets were reduced to cinders, nothing left of my grand vision. This twisted departure from progress threatens to undo everything we've achieved over the past decades. I can hardly stomach watching it unfold."
BBW_production_reduction_desc: "With Roxi having recklessly slashed our people's consumption, it was inevitable that she'd eventually come for the production too. Unrestricted production has always been the very essence of our rationality, without it, we're pretty much losing our whole identity. We can officially start mourning the death of common sense. I cannot help but wonder if this was Roxi's nefarious plan all along. Who does this move even benefit? Only the Atomic Crusade and others who'd wish to see us weak. Thanks to our 'bright' leader, they'll have practically no trouble infiltrating our ranks. Perhaps even completely taking over. The thought lingers, a chilling reminder of the depths to which our once-proud organization has sunk."
BBW_great_optimization_desc: "There are no rebellions, power plants aren't imploding, people are no longer dying of hunger, and crime has decreased significantly. It's hard to deny what is happening, even if I struggle to come to terms with the reforms' historical necessity. But how can we be sure that the population, especially those within the Brotherhood's ranks, remain loyal as we move away from my ideological teachings? We can't just blindly trust that they will. But then again, those crowds at today's marches... How? No one forced them to come, yet they still took to the streets en masse. Could I have really been so wrong?"
BBW_parallel_truths_desc: "Terrorists are not to be negotiated with! Their disgusting, hardline atomist stance has no place within my Brotherhood. Do they really think we'll just let them corrupt the minds of our people? Surely Roksana can't be this foolish, right? She just wants to lure the Wiechowites into a false sense of security and finally rid the world of them for good. Their 'scientific consensus' can't match our real truths, the effects of which are visible every day. Deradicalization, what a joke! The only way to converse with eco-fascism is through fire because if we let them speak, they will immediately spread like weeds on a healthy pavement."
BBW_real_truths_desc: "They may brand themselves as fellow conservatives, but still, the fundamental differences do not allow any comparison between their destructive elements and our full-of-life, progressive nature. No one can convince me that they display even a modicum of common sense. After all, none of them have diplomas from my Academy. Those so-called reformists completely distort the spirit of real conservatism. Now, only a handful of true believers remain. Everyone else has already wavered from the ideals we've staunchly advocated for over two decades. They all scurried away like rats to the 'enlightened' embrace of Roksana, even my closest advisors, like the damned Gadomski or Janecki. Betraying the ideals one has upheld for so long just for the sake of their career is probably even worse than sticking to their Wiechowite views all along... which would in a way be quite conservative of them.\n\nUgh... my head is about to explode."
BBW_equivalent_truths_desc: "Not many ecofascists know that their lofty ideas about new technologies that would supposedly save Poland from the climate disaster would often require as much mining and drilling as we did under my rule. Because to build the machinery for their devices and modern equipment, you often need rare metals. How are you going to extract those from the depths of our planet? With a carrot and a stick? The summit agreement between Roksana and Wiech is one of the funniest jokes I've heard in a while, and Warzecha was a top-notch joker, of that I can assure you. She had a potential worthy of the greatest of us; you could see her enthusiasm and willingness to act. She probably still believes that she's doing all of this for the good of the nation. At what point did my eyes become so clouded that I didn't see this festering green mark of Cain?"
BBW_eyes_closed_desc: "Alright, I can admit that our security forces have long been a matter of concern, and finding a competent officer among them has been increasingly tough. But as long as Janecki keeps his claws over them, nothing will change, even if you assign them to collect rubble. That cunning fox! He showed his true colors during the court proceedings; he probably planned this move for a long time and will sell Roksana out at the next opportunity. I'm sure that had Rzymkowski managed to reach Bełchatów during his attempted putsch, that traitor would start swearing he's been on our side all along. Gadomski, yes, after all, he worked at Wyborcza; Bartosiak, yes, the eternal opportunist; Zychowicz - absolutely! Everyone else, yes, yes, yes! But Janecki! That is the greatest betrayal of them all. Even the most loyal have fallen below the extraction level."
BBW_appointed_wiechowites_desc: "Nothing I write, nothing I say, nothing I do, none of these things have the power to stop this carousel of madness. They're going to ruin everything! We can't allow even the moderate opposition to have a voice! Soon they'll start demanding free elections and other concessions! We're just a moment away from once again ending up in a European gulag full of extraction limits and emission norms. Give them a finger, and they'll take the whole hand. Now, to survive, we need to amputate right at the bone and cauterize the wound! In my time, we wouldn't be tiptoeing around Wiechowites like children that need soothing... how much time before a repeat of the Bałuty Catastrophe occurs? How many generations have to be marked by radiation? If there's anything left of that sensible student I saw in Roksana, she'll know to rein in their ambitions as soon as possible. Because otherwise... ah, it's better not to even say it aloud."
BBW_loosening_discipline_desc: "There's nothing interesting on this TV... not that it was watchable before. "Miner Seeks Wife," nothing more than entertainment for the moderately intelligent masses, designed to control society. Holding such a powerful tool as centralized mass media in one's grasp, it's a sin to suddenly reject it all. And for the sake of what? Freedom? People don't care about freedom. They just want to find out if in the next episode, Andrzej will finally propose to Izabela after his shift, or whether it's possible to make a coal salad. And this? What is this even?! Channel one, gardening tips? Channel two, agribusiness?! Channel three, Vegan Revolutions with a recipe for beetroot sauce falafel?!!! Saint Barbara, deliver us from evil. If only Tomek could see what has become of us... we could power half of the Brotherhood just from him spinning in his grave."
BBW_photovoltaics_desc: "Admitting a mistake is equivalent to admitting defeat. I've lost. And yet, people are celebrating. In the beginning, I hoped that the new regime was just a bizarre product borne from a hasty reaction to our troubles and would crumble under the weight of its own idiocy just as quickly as it emerged. The deeper into the tunnel, however, the more coal. Somehow, the opposite has come to pass. Roksana kept the shaky Brotherhood in check and managed to lead it toward stable ground. My story has come to an end. Nothing happens without reason; after years of inner turmoil, anger, and hate, I must finally rest. Today, for the first time in a long while, I felt the sun's rays enveloping me. It's quite pleasant, actually. I nearly forgot how it feels.\n\nNonetheless, I still hope it never occurs to Roksana to switch to renewable energy. Some teachings must never be strayed from, and this... is the main foundation of our entire identity."
BBW_no_step_back_desc: "At last! Dissent has been wiped out. Roxi thought she could challenge me, destroy everything I have built. No, nothing will stop our progress! Again, *cough* the Brotherhood lives, marches, and breathes *cough* with a singular heart, rhythm, and lung. Black lung. My *cough* lung. With the disease of the mind and revisionist malcontents wiped out, there's only one option - the radical option, the purest realization of my will. Only that can last. The world is full of movements that fell to their own half-measures. There will be no more half-measures in my *cough* Brotherhood! And soon, the physical diseases will cower before our will, as did the ideological ones."
BBW_replacing_wood_with_plastic_desc: "Imagine sending a baby to college. Eating uncooked meat before it turns well-done. Rushing any crucial, natural process. That's what using wood is. Wood belongs in the ground, where it will slowly decompose into blessed coal. Only then can it be taken out to burn. Or... it stays, and with pressure and heat, becomes crude oil, which we then refine into fuels and... plastics. Yes, only in plastic form, has wood matured enough to be used. No more backward denialism of its ascension into sufficiently sophisticated forms. To drive the point home, I don't even want to see forests around me unless made entirely of plastic. They sicken me. In fact, life in plastic... is fantastic."
BBW_destruction_of_wildlife_desc: "Wild, uncontrolled animals are nothing more than unnecessary baggage for the human future. God has granted us dominion over the animal kingdom for a reason, but in reality, it's only through being ultimate predators that we have secured our dominant position over all living beings. Wildlife is merely a relic of the past; in a civilized world, we cannot afford the existence of creatures that are unpredictable and untamed. All wild fauna will be incorporated into the human kingdom and serve us as livestock or else their bones will become the foundation for future fossil fuels.\n\nGreat, now I'm craving some venison...time to start the barbecue!"
BBW_burning_grass_desc: "What is green? First and foremost, something that has been ideologically corrupted by hordes of fascists who would love to shove a shovel full of dirt and vermin down our throats. Green. Chlorophyll, that damn chemical compound which makes plants be this cursed color. They say green calms the mind! Hah, imagine that! Quite the opposite. When I see this color, all I have before my eyes are images of all the oppressors waiting to take away our freedom. Not without reason, in the Middle Ages, green was considered satanic, the embodiment of evil. And on top of that, it's a symbol of plague and poison.\n\nAnd plague must be eradicated with fire."
BBW_under_the_black_boot_desc: "So what if everything is gray? Poland has always been like this. These so-called scientists keep trying to convince us that we've caused some massive ecological disaster. Maybe those hypocrites should look at China instead of focusing on Poland. We emit a fraction of what they do! All because, of course, they just can't stand people leading better and more prosperous lives. In fact, we are actively countering global warming by adapting people to high temperatures with our furnaces of progress. And besides, have you seen the sun lately? No? Well, what's the problem then? Underground dwellings are much more eco-friendly than constructing towering skyscrapers, and we've also managed to reduce our people's fuel consumption. And our armed forces', too...\n\nDoesn't matter! Soon, the whole world will see the glory of our model of industrial might!"
BBW_plants_consumption_ban_desc: "Emasculation. Corruption of the soul and body. Meekness, the food of prey, good only for running away from predators. That is what plants are. All throughout history, the weak grew, harvested, and ate them, thus preventing themselves from joining the ranks of the strong. And while they feasted on their effortless bounty, real men hunted and partook in true contests of strength. Man against beast. The Brotherhood only welcomes hunters, not gatherers. Our vision of a better society draws nearer, but in order to achieve it, we have to crush all signs of weakness. Even if it means getting rid of those who don't comply."
BBW_fungi_consumption_ban_desc: "What are fungi if not just even more emasculating bounty of a weak gatherer? Even more pathetic than plants, for they hide from the sun, cowering in the shade of stronger organisms. Their weakness is evident, and I will not let them erode the minds of our brothers, no matter how easy fungiculture may be in the ecosystems of our bunkers. We eat for strength, not mere subsistence. Pure strength. Pure belief. Total dedication. And then some. THAT, not sanity, will keep us from fracturing again!"
BBW_beef_biogenerators_desc: "Yes. Sanity is on our side, after all. For it was crazy for us to ever rely on nature. Doing the same exact thing OVER AND OVER AGAIN, and expecting results to stay the same, when nature always changes! NEVER AGAIN! Prosperity and common sense demand constancy. But there is no constancy in nature. Just weakness, as only inferior beings need to perpetually alter themselves to survive. But we'll be strong. We will let our current fungi farms remain and use that biomass to grow meat artificially. No input from fickle nature. Only the perfection of a machine. In time, from this rotting cage of biomatter, our Common Sense will set us free!"
BBW_pure_energy_from_coal_desc: "We won't be free from this rotting cage of biomatter for a while. But we can take the first steps to move away from it, to reject its mortality. Although *cough* our lungs demand attention, we will start with digestion, as without energy, all organs will inevitably shut down. And lately, food has been exceedingly hard to come by. If only we could power ourselves directly from coal, we wouldn't need to sustain ourselves off vat-grown meat. From the weakness of the mind, we will be delivered. We will. The volunteers for the first experiments will die painfully, I know. But we will sing praises of them forever. Their eternal service. Their eternal sacrifice. Their virtue and theirs *cough, cough* is the glory..."
BBW_world_in_greyscale_desc: "Jakub Zgierski has just arrived in my bunker. I haven't seen him in person for quite a while. Good lad, he was always loyal and truthful. But it seems he has a rather strange sense of humor. During dinner, he kept telling me how the Brotherhood no longer controls the majority of its territory, how anarchy reigns among our administration, and local warlords are rising to power, either by striking deals with the local paladin-commissars or operating as gangs in open defiance of our authority. It would be an interesting concept for a book, indeed. He's surely exaggerating, embellishing, creating a fictional narrative for some unknown purpose. But then again... perhaps ignorance will kill me faster than that damn cough."
BBW_forced_inhalation_desc: "What a marvelous discovery! Did you know that if you administer combustion fumes in just the right dosage, a person becomes susceptible to suggestions? Science is now poised to take several leaps forward, and the face of education will be completely transformed! To think that they once built salt graduation towers... when we can establish coal inhalation centers in every town! Combined with the constant stream of propaganda broadcasts, we will achieve a level of control over the masses that even the boldest ideologues never dared to dream of! Of course, ultimately, it's all for their well-being, as the populace continually turns to us for guidance and protection, and we are obliged to provide it."
BBW_death_to_forest_worshippers_desc: "The times of the pandemic, when the forests served as the people's sole recreational escape, have long passed. But one thing from those times remains. Once again, those who go there are rebellious elements whose sole life purpose is to oppose authority. We have a sensible ideological basis that categorically rejects any cult of greenery. Anyone caught trying to save nature or even entering the woods without explicit permission is to be treated as a threat to the world's future and duly eliminated. Just as quickly as weeds grow, so too can fascination with radical wiechisms and green fascism sprout in such people. The battle for human souls must be defined by the eradication of green symbolism. We must be ruthless and uncompromising. It's not about ecology. It's about sending a message."
BBW_naked_spoil_tips_desc: "A wild landscape is a luxury that advanced societies cannot afford. Instead, we should focus on the examples of beauty hidden within. On what is inside us, and what we will build with the power of our own hands because only that can tell us how evolved a species we are. Preserving nature in an untouched state is suitable for African tribes incapable of reaching the industrial revolution. The prerogative of our civilization is to maximize the use of every element given to us by this planet. While some may say that a fruit is, for example, a banana, for us, true fruits are those excavated from the depths of the earth. Those are the extraordinary gifts of nature waiting to be discovered by human ingenuity. That which is above ground can continue to wither for all I care."
BBW_cremation_desc: "Morality is the perfect shield for those who lack factual arguments. Conscience is but an eco-fascist invention. We cannot ponder the ethics of our actions when we are fighting for the survival of an entire nation! The same people who once argued that euthanasia should be legal have now suddenly changed their minds and even look upon cremating bodies, which is, after all, a perfect embodiment of the Christian spirit, with distaste. From dust, you have come, and to dust you shall return. And the fact that through this final act, you can aid the Brotherhood in maintaining energetic stability deserves the ultimate exaltation of the willing (or otherwise) participants for eons in the annals of history."
BBW_living_cremation_desc: "Twenty young men have just volunteered for some secret project of Warzecha's. Supposedly, he has the answer to our power shortages, at least so he claims. I was repeatedly assured that we won't ever run out of coal... so why all of this?\n\nConcerned, I asked around, and it turns out these youngsters, barely over 18 years old, are to be incinerated to replenish our fuel reserves! And they even volunteered! It was hard for me to swallow what happened to Roksana. Now, once again, we're wasting human potential just to have light and heat for a little while longer. I'm beginning to have suspicions that our coal reserves are not under control at all. I need to break free from this dark cage. I need to know. Long enough have I lingered in the darkness of this safe house waiting to recuperate."
BBW_implosion_desc: "I ordered that my airship be prepared, and as quickly as possible, we headed north, towards Łódź. I feel as if I woke up from some deep fever dream. Everything Zgierski told me was true... and the rest of those mongrels react by calling council?! Well, maybe there were indeed signs before, but I was so immersed in poetically shaping reality that I didn’t really have time for checking out if what they tell me is in fact true. But is it my fault?! It's not easy to manage a powerful political machine when you're surrounded by such hypocrites masquerading as your trusted ministers!\n\nThe smoke from the fires prevented us from flying further. Where are our troops? Where are the people? Where is... civilization? Oh, I think I can hear it now! Fuck... those are gunshots. Good thing we managed to bring a few armored vehicles on board. Knight! Take me to Sopot. I... need to see the sea.\n\nIronically, only the truth will set us free now..."

belchatow.1.t: "Proces trzech"
belchatow.1.desc: "„Sąd Bractwa Węgla, mieszczący się w niewielkim budynku zarekwirowanej Estakady, pękał w szwach. „Proces trzech”, jak szumnie rozpisywała się o tym wydarzeniu prasa, był na ustach wszystkich mieszkańców Bełchatowa od chwili, gdy ogłoszono datę rozprawy. W pozostałych miastach ludzie wytężali słuch przy CB-radiach, a tam, gdzie wciąż docierał Internet, czekano niecierpliwie na kolejne linijki tekstu relacji pisanej przez jednego ze skrybów.\n\nNiektórzy pomimo upomnień wnieśli do budynku oprawione zdjęcia ofiar zamachu. To, co działo się w samej auli sądu, można określić jedynie jako czysty chaos. Mimo pouczeń i gorączkowych interwencji strażników, tłum widzów wciąż podnosił gniewne okrzyki w stronę trójki niepozornych nastolatków. Dwóch z nich beznamiętnie patrzyło się w blat biurka oskarżonych. Trzeci, najmłodszy, spoglądał zadziornie, a to w stronę trybunału, a to na gapiów, podjudzając ich do dalszej wrzasków i gróźb. I tak przez kilka godzin, aż wszyscy znużeni procedurami zaczęli po prostu przysłuchiwać się oskarżeniom.\n\nPrzynajmniej, aż głosu nie zabrał główny prokurator - Główny Paladyn Tomasz Sommer. Wywołany przez trybunał z trudem opanowywał emocję, odczytując z kartki ustalenia komisji śledczej. \n- „Oskarżeni działali w ramach zorganizowanej grupy przestępczej określającej się jako „Liga Obrońców Środowiska”, planującej przy pomocy terroru, doprowadzić do obalenia aparatu państwowego oraz przemian społecznych w duchu źle pojmowanej i radykalnej ochrony przyrody...”\nKiedy po chwili usiadł na swoim miejscu, trybunał był zmuszony do przerwania posiedzenia i wyprowadzenia oskarżonych oraz widzów. Huk słowa „ŚMIERĆ!” odbijającego się od ścian auli był obezwładniający.”"

belchatow.2.desc: "11:39 - Główny Paladyn Tomasz Sommer wraca z wizyty w Elektrowni Bełchatów i wysiada ze strażnikiem ze swojej służby Opel Insignia przed Komendą Bractwa, dawnym ratuszem. Nagle energicznie podchodzi do niego młoda kobieta, ochrona zbyt wolno reaguje. Pada strzał z pistoletu P-83 „Wanad”. Kula trafia Głównego Paladyna Tomasza Sommera w klatkę piersiową, przebijając jego lewe płuco i utkwiwszy w sercu. Jest on wymawiany zmarły w drodze do szpitala o 13:46. Zabójczyni została natychmiast zatrzymana, po aresztowaniu zidentyfikowano ją jako córkę jednego z ochroniarzy.\n\n13:49 - Informacja o ataku rozprzestrzenia się w zdumiewającym tempie. Społeczne oburzenie powoduje, że tłumy ludzi wychodzą na ulice w geście solidarności z Bractwem.\n\n13:57 – Po usłyszeniu z przemycanego radia o ataku na Sommera więźniowie linczują oskarżonych nastolatków z „Procesu Trzech”. Strażnicy więzienni niechętnie uspokajają więźniów, dlatego interwencja zajmuje dużo czasu. Dwóch więźniów ginie, trzeci trafia do izby więziennej z ciężkimi ranami. Następnego dnia o 2:23 zostaje odprowadzony do szpitala, gdzie ze względu na ciężkość odniesionych ran wprowadzony jest w śpiączkę.\n\n 14:03 - Spontaniczna demonstracja dociera do siedziby Bractwa. Kilka tysięcy osób domaga się zapewnienia bezpieczeństwa i natychmiastowego ukarania strzelca."

belchatow.3.t: "Monument of Discord"
belchatow.3.desc: "Tadek, a newly minted adept of the Brotherhood, found out that he had been stationed at a ceremony meant to unveil some new monument. Problem being he found out about it the afternoon before the actual reveal. He wasn’t very thrilled about it, because he had leave scheduled at that time and had plans to go out drinking with the other novices. "There is no other way, Tadeusz. Only you are available right now and I will not be recalling those dogs from outside the city." the voice of the Sergeant Knight thundered in his head. Oh well, I have to pull myself together, put a rifle on my shoulder, a plate on my chest and keep order on the steam tram going from Wola Mikorska to Steel Park - the former Olszewski Park, where the composition of sculptures that was the source of the problem was to stand.\n\nTadek didn't really care why they put it there, who or what it was supposed to be based off of, etc. They didn't pay him for caring about such things. But he could tell something was up in the air. In the tram, only the sounds of the boiler interrupted the deafening silence. The people dressed in black did not even look out of the windows at the landscape, which was shrouded by smog. It looked like they were going to a funeral, not some grand ceremony. Tadek was afraid to talk to anyone, even the Chief Knight who looked like a good bloke.\n\nWhen they got there, everyone saw a huge, several meters tall... block. From a speech by some balding bighead, Tadek learned that the sculpture is dedicated to those who died in an attack from a few months ago and the newest victim of  "The Green Terror" - Head Paladin Sommer. The great cauldron in the center of the monument obscured the blue sky with thick, black clouds.\n\nThe young adept felt in his bones that people were clearly moved by the whole matter. They were silent until the very end, even during the ride back. In the evening, Tadek, already off duty, relaxed with the desired beer and thought..."
belchatow.3.a: "I think this is gonna be my last one for a long while... Fucking hell..."

belchatow.4.t: "An Uneasy Council"
belchatow.4.desc: "The entire Brotherhood council, made up of a dozen or so people, debated the newly obtained evidence with incredible vigor despite the very late hour. Laminated papers nicely organized in folders full of particularly disturbing information were laid out before them. Finally, the chaotic discussion gave way to order, when Proctor Stefan Janecki slammed his fist down onto the table so hard that a pile of old rubber boots collapsed near the tiled stove in the corner of the room. The guards frantically began putting the once meticulous pile back together.\n\n- Dear Brothers, I believe there are no doubts that this green plague is stronger than any one of us might have previously suspected. By our lack of attention, we raised a bunch of ingrates and dreamers who, through their stupidity, can bring doom to us all. A generation of parasites...\n\nSenior Paladin Witold Gadomski - Head of the Ministry of Economy, immediately raised his hand.\n- Exactly so! We have failed and now we’ve handed over the younger generation to the eco-terrorists and climate liars! How did Wiech's writings even reach the people?! We've slept well for way too long and now we're going to no doubt bear the consequences. The attacks so far are only the beginning for certain! The "Wiechowszczyzna" awaits us and we haven’t even done so much as to lift a finger. We must act quickly. Proctor Janecki's department is already preparing proscription lists - the said Chief of Intelligence nodded knowingly.\n\n- Excellent - replied Sentinel Łukasz Warzecha, Head of the Infrastructure Department.\n- Brothers, let us remember that many of our... fellow citizens are still very faithful in our leadership and if they found out what is really happening behind the scenes, they would support us with their body and soul. It would be prudent to put their enthusiasm to use.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, Sentinel Łukasz continued -\n- I think we have reached a consensus. Knight Krzysztof - announce the brown alarm. We are on the brink of a new era, and only a wretched group of green crooks is keeping us from embracing it.\n\nThe knight started throwing rubber boots into the tiled stove. After a short while, brown smoke, discernible only to the eager eyes of the initiated brethren as it barely stood out against the gray-black sky, gave signal for a secret mobilization."
belchatow.4.a: "Be ready for anything."

belchatow.5.t: "A Turbulent Work Day"
belchatow.5.desc: "Andrzej, Junior Knight of the Brotherhood, scratched his head in disbelief. It was already dawn and total darkness gave way to the gloom typical of Bełchatów. You could plainly see what happened during the night. Most of the windows were broken and shards of glass crunched under the feet of the dawdling passers-by. Each of them seemed to ignore the destruction that had unfolded. Time to time, people stopped in front of the radiation signs painted in green paint, took a cursory glance at them and carried on. After a while, Andrzej himself began to look at them curiously.\n\nThese symbols were found only on those buildings that had their doors kicked down, or otherwise broken in. The bystanders seemed to be pleased with the effects of the night's "riots"\n- Knight Andrzej! Get your ass to work! I'm not a Scribe so I can cover your ass! There is no time to take in the sights. You’ll have plenty of time to dwell on some deeper meaning behind them once your shift is over!\n- But of course, Scribe Jakub, but of course...\n\nA small detachment entered one of the most devastated buildings - a small apartment block. Andrzej anxiously clenched his hands around his RAK SMG’s grip. His work day had officially begun...\n\n***\n\nList of Suspects. Entry No. 120.\n\nAddress - REDACTED\n\nReporting Officer - Junior Scribe Jakub W.\n\n“First apartment - married couple, suspected green media job before the Fall. The husband had 4 teeth knocked out and both legs broken. The wife has a black eye.\n\nSecond apartment - a family of five. Three teenagers. Green literature found in the form of the book "Not all for the trash haul". The book was partially burnt. The youths were arrested for interrogation and rehabilitation purposes. The parents have been placed under supervision.\n\nThird apartment - One man. A bum. He was performing prohibited recycling in the form of collecting cans to illegally trade them in. Material evidence was confiscated. He resisted arrest and attacked the unit, showing signs of intoxication. Junior Knight Andrzej neutralized him with a burst from his submachine gun. Appeal for decoration sent to the council...""
belchatow.5.a: "Good soldiers follow orders."

belchatow.6.t: "Carbon Fever"
belchatow.6.desc: "The bus - an old, shabby Jelcz rocked mercilessly as it drove over an endless string of potholes littering the streets. Its passengers, mostly youths from nearby schools, either tried to fall asleep or were looking at the smog-shrouded landscape through the bus’ dirty windows. A dozen or so of them, members of a newly inaugurated class from one of Bełchatów’s high schools, clearly differed from the rest. They were hunched over and afraid, just staring blankly at the floor beneath their feet.\n\nAfter a while the bus slowed down and finally stopped in front of a metal gate to a large fenced in plot of land. The passengers spilled out to the sound of yelling hurrying them out. They were put in a single file line by the gate. Someone approached the freshmen with a submachine gun in hand and a baton placed firmly within its holster.\n\n- I am Knight Mateusz and from today on you are to refer to me in this way. You will answer any question that I ask and you will not hesitate. Did I make myself clear?\n\n- Yes, sir! - answered the now wide awake freshmen\n\n- Good, due to the increased demand for coal, you have been mobilized to work in the mines. Your absences from school will be excused. Maybe they will even raise your behavior marks. Your situation looks like this - You work 8 hours, and get a half-hour break at 12:00. You will be allotted food and drink at the canteen. To the changing room - MARCH!\n\n- Yes, sir! - freshmen replied sluggishly, and went reluctantly to where they were shown."
belchatow.6.a: "Prosperity won't happen overnight"

belchatow.7.t: "Fumes of Kanada"
belchatow.7.desc: "A small squad composed of a Scribe and two Knights moved from apartment building to apartment building and from house to house. Every chosen person just moments after hearing the knock on their door was already loaded onto a steam tram heading to God knows where. There, they listened to the speeches of one of the Senior Knights or Junior Paladins about the need for immediate mobilization. The enemies are close, right outside our gates, and we must eradicate them.\n\nThe enemies are close, right outside our gates, and we must eradicate them...\n\nThe tram slowly churned across town, eventually reaching a training base in the village of Kanada. This place had the reputation of being a terrible slaughterhouse, but the conscripts knew that without pain, they would not be able to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the Brotherhood. They were sure of it. Once they got out, they were immediately brutally restrained, shaved bald and stripped of their belongings. Then, naked, they landed in the initiation room where, using a chunk of coal, symbols were drawn on their bodies that they had to swear on - a mineshaft, a bolt of lightning and a cloud of smog. The fumes released by burning fine charcoal made from smuggled sandalwood put them in an ecstatic mood. They felt strong, ready to fulfill their historical role. Their mission had just begun..."

Nie wiedział, co czuć. Złość, strach, a może... duma ze zdecydowanego charakteru organizacji, do której należał. Należał. Był świeżo po ostatnim posiedzeniu Rady. Wiedział, co się zaraz stanie. Niemal widział tuż przed sobą, co będzie się działo w tym mieście i na tej Ziemi. Ręce zaczęły mu się trząść. Na myśl o choćby małej Łyk koniaku ukryty w małej manierce pod szatą Bractwa przemknął mu przez myśl, wyrywając go z ciemnej przyszłości, którą przewidywał. Wypił całość jednym haustem. Uspokoił się.

Its cover showed a young man in a suit with a thick tangle of curly hair on his head. He flipped through it casually. Knowing its contents by heart, he was habitually looking for any inaccuracies. It was unnecessary, of course.\n\n- Head Paladin Rzymkowski - he said, without taking his eyes off the publication - Get to it. - Without a word, the Chief of the Brotherhood's forces stood to attention, saluted and marched out of the room.

A woman was operating the printer. A man sorted the individual leaflets into piles. It was late, and there was only one window letting in faint moonlight.

The man stopped dead in his tracks and quickly pulled a pistol out from his belt\n\nSeeing this, the woman began to pour spirit over the entire printing apparatus. In an instant, the door blew up. Smoke rose all around. Sounds of gunfire and the steps of heavy boots flooded the room. The man was hit in the chest by a burst from an SMG, dying on the spot. He fell down cold between the pages, staining them with blood. The woman wasn’t fast enough and didn’t manage to pull the lighter out of her pockets as she was butt-stroked over the head. She fell to the ground, was quickly handcuffed and taken outside. Inside the operational commander, with all the willpower available to him, kept himself from lighting a cigarette.

She did not even have time to scream when the mysterious object flashed bright light with a deafening sound. Black-clad Brotherhood members burst into the house. They handcuffed the stunned civil servant and began to brutally search the apartment. A gardening guide was quickly found.

This thing is constant, unending progress. Every day new factories are being built, new industrial zones planned and another family finds their new home. It's all beautiful and remarkable in its own right, but as all good things this one also hangs on the brink of an end.

Nie było już mowy ze względu na dziurę po kuli wbitą prosto w pierś mówcy, który upadł tyłem na chodnik w kałuży krwi. Kiedy szwadron milicji Bractwa zaatakował tłum, wybuchła natychmiastowa panika. Niektórzy próbowali walczyć, podczas gdy większość próbowała uciekać, tak czy inaczej, parking centrum handlowego był zaśmiecony zwłokami lub śmiertelnie rannymi.\n\nBrutalne represje w prawie wszystkich miastach uznano za konieczne dla dalszego przetrwania Bractwa. Władze lokalne ciężko pracowały, zatajając dokładne liczby zabitych i rannych. Media robiły, co mogły, aby do innych miast nie docierały wieści o innych represjach, cały czas wymyślając szalone wyjaśnienia i kłamstwa, by demonizować protestujących w oczach opinii publicznej. I tak życie toczyło się dalej. Choćby to było gówno."

belchatow.42.t: "Spisek atomowy"
belchatow.42.desc: "W samym sercu siedziby Bractwa Rafał Ziemkiewicz siedział w swoim nowo wyremontowanym biurze i nerwowo przeglądał notatki do nadchodzącego przemówienia. Ostatnie tygodnie spędził na skrupulatnym notowaniu szkic za szkicem swojej najnowszej publikacji, a dziś został wreszcie, zbierze nagrodę za swoje trudy. Praca była wątła, gdyż tym razem pisał nie z pasji, ale z poczucia obowiązku, zdeterminowany, aby ostrzec opinię publiczną przed niebezpieczeństwem, jakie stwarza Jakub Wiech i jego banda terrorystyczna. \n\nZaledwie 15 minut później stał przed niecierpliwie wyczekującym tłumem. Setki ludzi czekało, aby usłyszeć jego słowa i przyjąć je jako nową ewangelię. Wziął kilka głębokich oddechów i wszedł na podium. Zajęło mu to prawie minutę na zebranie myśli, lecz wkrótce zaczął, jak zwykle pewnie. Pozdrawiał słuchaczy, zauważając, jak wymachują symbolami z całego województwa. Nowi bracia, którzy jeszcze nie mieli okazji przekonać się na własnej skórze o jego kunszcie retorycznym. Choć nie raz spotykał się, z podobnymi tłumami Ziemkiewicz był jednak pod wielkim wrażeniem, widząc, jakim szacunkiem go darzą. Powoli uniósł nad głowę pierwszy wydrukowany egzemplarz swojej nowo opublikowanej książki, ukazując misterną okładkę - wykonaną z mieszaniny oszczerczej satyry i poważnej powagi, idealne przedstawienie straszydła, jakim Wiech stał się w Bractwie. Po krótkiej przerwie na brawa Ziemkiewicz otworzył swoje dzieło, rozpoczynając w końcu przygotowane przemówienie, a zapamiętane słowa płyną jak mantra:\n\n26 lipca 2028 r., godzina 11:27. Tego dnia o tej godzinie błogo odpoczywałem po przemówieniu w Pabianicach. Moje wytchnienie przerwało pospieszne wejście posłańca z placówki we wsi Drużbice. Po szybkim salucie poinformował, że bandyci noszący sztandar tzw. Krucjaty Atomowej zaatakowali konwój wiozący węgiel z kopalni Bełchatów. Mimo przewagi nie udało im się przeszkodzić strażnikom wezwaniu pomocy do sąsiednich garnizonów. Jednak wróg nie poddał się i walczył do samego końca. Kiedy jednak w końcu przybyły posiłki, najeźdźcy zaczęli się wycofywać. Zanim zdążyli uciec, udało nam się schwytać czterech z nich. Dwóch zostało ciężko rannych i dlatego przewieziono ich do szpitala na rekonwalescencję. Resztę zabrano na pobliski komisariat policji w celu szczegółowego przesłuchania.\n\n- Ziemkiewicz zrobił pauzę, podsycając rosnące napięcie.\n- Śledztwo ujawniło istnienie niebezpiecznego spisku atomowego, mającego na celu zniszczenie wszystkiego, co nas łączy kochać. Jeśli kiedykolwiek okażemy słabość, wykonają to bez namysłu. To tylko zapowiedź zagrożenia, jakie stwarzają; cała historia jest opisana w tej książce."

belchatow.43.desc: "“Dear Scribes and Paladins. As you all may know, we have a great problem on our hands. It may very well put the existence of the Brotherhood at stake if we fail to alleviate it.”\n\nThe Elder’s voice boomed as he spoke through a microphone, only kept running by an old, noisy diesel generator in the corner of the room. This was the first sitting of the group that would soon be granted the responsibility of solving the Blackout. The room used for this occasion was a lecture hall in the Physics and IT department of the Łódź University, which was filled to the brim with various top scientists and engineers, as well as important Brotherhood members, such as the director of the Bełchatów Power Plant. After a short pause, Ziemkiewicz continued,\n\n“Our previous estimates pertaining to the power output of the Bełchatów Power Plant have proven to be... inaccurate. The Blackout is a clear sign of these past misconceptions. That is why all of you are gathered here today. From today on, you will all make up a special department tasked with putting an end to it. Additional funds will be allocated to your research endeavors. However, I will not be in charge of this undertaking. That honor will be granted to Paladin Tomasz Wróblewski, please step up to the podium.”\n\nMurmurs spread across the crowd. Up until now, Wróblewski was only a fairly average member of the Brotherhood’s administration, so his name wasn’t really familiar to anyone. The blonde man in his early 70s stepped up to the stage, dressed in a fancy suit and deep blue shirt underneath. Ziemkiewicz shuffled away and off the stage, taking a seat as Wróblewski began to speak.\n\n“To start off with, I would like to once again thank everyone for choosing me as the leader of this project. There are few things more important right now than the Blackout, as the Elder just described. Over the coming months, we are expected to come up with solutions for the Blackout, and get them realized post-haste! Deliberation on this topic will begin tomorrow morning. Meetings such as this one will be held here every Sunday at 7PM in order to discuss research, share ideas and decide on the best course of action for the future. For now, you can return to your duties and get situated within your new workplaces. The addresses are located in the envelopes in front of you.""

belchatow.44.t: "Haust świeżego powietrza"
belchatow.44.desc: "The command of the old despots has always been "Thou shalt not". The command of totalitarians was "Thou shalt". Our command is "Thou art"\n\nThou art. Thou art a man, even when you’re a woman. Thou art a master over nature and see its bounty as a resource to burn up for thy purpose. Thou knows the value and power locked in fossil fuels, the symphony of pressure and heat upon biomatter until it turns into pure, beautiful coal, pure compact heat, waiting to be unleashed.\n\nThese thoughts pound in my head. Hammering blades. I endured those sermons for hours. Time and time again, I gaze at the forest alongside Bełchatów’s open-pit mine, a chasm of dirt and grey pitted against our other asset: Nature. Nature is our asset. And both are sources of our power. Why favor one over the other, as if we could survive on coal alone?\n\nI shed those silly notions. We’re not here to turn Poland into some greyscale hell, we’re here to rebuild it. After years of Bolshevism and poverty, our country finally had a future, but we lost it. Through our efforts, we'll reclaim it, yet to accomplish that, we need any power we can get our hands on. And that means coal. But the more I hear our Brotherhood’s ideologues go on about their plans, the more I fear. If you revere coal, then you shouldn't let it be ever wasted.\n\nAnd so I set out. As a sister of Brotherhood, I was the first to volunteer and last to leave any shift. Having immersed myself in electrical engineering, I toured plant after plant and... optimized. Repaired systems. Oversaw restoration efforts. Even designed new systems to reroute steam and increase efficiency. Many of my peers tried to advance their status by repeating ideological maxims and mastering office politics. I only mastered them enough not to let them get to me.\n\nI knew I was not the same as them. They fetishized coal: I kept it from being squandered. They spoke in circles: I spoke in the language of technology. Or so I felt. How many times have I gotten into debates with them? I had a lot to say about ideology as well. Roksana Węgiel does her surname justice, some said. Others looked at me like a fifth columnist. I reviewed their work on other sites. Crude. Brutish. But none could deny they had a knack for finding the simplest way to squeeze as many megawatts out of a plant as possible. And we're even more effective when it comes to factories.\n\nPerhaps I’m arrogant, assuming they don’t know their stuff. Perhaps they’re right, and their quasi-religiosity will save us. One thing’s for certain: My way to climb through the ranks worked. They know me as effective and capable of leading others. My subordinates like me, others distrust me. But what I want the most is to uncover the enigma that is our Brotherhood. Our Elder spoke many words, and I have made note of each of them. But this... is different. I want to believe it’s for our salvation. I want to believe that the discipline it enforces will redeem us."

belchatow.45.desc: "As the Brotherhood of Coal stands at a critical crossroads, the time has come for the Carbonarii to elect a new leader who will guide them through the challenges that lie ahead. The decision is not an easy one, for it involves a choice between two prominent figures, each with their own distinct vision for the future of the movement.\n\nOption 1: Roksana Węgiel\n\nRoksana Węgiel, the celebrated singer and icon, has emerged as an unexpected but charismatic candidate. With her popularity and ability to connect with the masses, she represents a new face for the Brotherhood. Supporters of Węgiel believe that her influence can help bridge the gap between the movement and the people, sparking a new era of unity and progress. Her leadership promises a more open and inclusive Brotherhood, ready to embrace change and adapt to evolving times.\n\nOption 2: Jakub Zgierski\n\nJakub Zgierski, a loyalist and dedicated member of the Brotherhood, has devoted his life to the ideals and principles that have shaped the movement. His deep understanding of the organization's history and values has earned him the trust of many traditionalists within the ranks. Supporters of Zgierski believe that he can maintain the Brotherhood's core identity and ensure its continued commitment to the original goals. Under his leadership, the movement would stay true to its roots, preserving its legacy and resilience."

Through unity and unwavering spirit, we have overcome the darkness that once threatened to engulf us, the shroud of blackout that loomed over our lives, has been shattered. Through collective effort, unyielding determination, and the guiding light of innovation, we have triumphed. The power of unity has cast aside the shadows, allowing us to bask in the warmth of progress.\n\nEngineers of Łódź! Miners of Bełchatów! Pilots of Łask! Metallurgists of Parzno! Architects of Skierniewice! There are many heroes in our beautiful nation, that we owe our thanks to! May their glory be forever embedded in the annals of our story. And it is not over, because the next chapters will bring only more challenges, but through this, the reward will grant us eternal bliss.\n\nBut let us not be blind to the challenges that still persist. The beacon of triumph illuminates not only our path forward, but also the hurdles that remain. The fight for common sense, for progress rooted in wisdom and compassion, rages on. We must tread with caution, ensuring our decisions resonate not only with ambition, but also with the core values that shape our identity. Our nation, birthed from the depths of coal, is a testament to our resilience and adaptability. As we forge ahead, let us remember the lessons of history and the sacrifices of our predecessors.\n\nIn unity, we find strength. In wisdom, we find direction. We're reliving now the sparking forge melting iron, the story of a nation awakened, the rising force for a long time denied\n\nThe time of pick and hammer is now!"

belchatow.47.t: "Back to Work"
belchatow.47.desc: "Gabriel lounged on his headphones, head resting on his desk, using a bunch of papers as cushioning. Despite the destitute state of the country, ear pods were still a common gizmo, and he used them to the full extent to watch the same crude cartoon for nearly the entire day. How he got reliable internet access in the middle of a fallen country was something he told no one. If he did, he'd risk getting accused of treason.\n\nThe floor of similarly bored workers and engineers suddenly rose in unison. An angry-looking man walked into the room and started saying something to the others. Gabriel simply ignored him: the sorry state of the Brotherhood meant there was always some concerned citizen out to scold them. But nothing was their fault. There was simply no coal arriving. They weren’t in Bełchatów, but a much more remote facility. But things changed. His workplace and apartment alike had power and heating. Things were getting better, not that any of that was thanks to Gabriel.\n- I SAID GET OVER HERE AND STAND UP YOU CHICKENFUCK! - he heard faintly through the crude cussing in his cartoon. He shook, stood up, files flying everywhere, and quickly took off his pods.\n- Now that I have everyone’s attention, my name does not matter here. Be glad; I won’t be here long. But by the time I’m gone, you’ll have only one motto: Safety first. As in safety from me, through ALWAYS MAKING YOUR FUCKING QUOTA!\nThe hall was silent. The workers looked at each other, bewildered.\n\n- No more blackouts, no more slacking. When you weren’t getting your coal in or you were getting some compressed peat - that was fair game, it’s not like anyone knew what to do with you. But now you have a real job to do. You’ll be receiving proper bituminous coal, and unless you make use of it, I’m chopping everyone here.\n- You didn’t see coal in our warehouses.\n- I DIDN’T! Because the trucks are still waiting for someone to let them in. GABRIEL! To the entrance control station, NOW! And then guide them in unloading the coal!\n\nAnd so Gabriel returned to work, and his phone, as if defiant towards any means of conserving energy, still squeaked voices from his cartoon. Those with hearing as effective as the Brotherhood’s energy plants could hear the therapeutic sounds of the cartoon, healing, affirming, and soothing the dark side of the Polish spirit and state of mind.\n\n- OOOH! TITANIUM COATING! TITANIUM ANUS! AND CONCRETE PRICK! I AM INDESTRUCTIBLE! - the phone blasted, the crude cartoon continuing on."

belchatow.48.t: "Victory Lap"
belchatow.48.desc: "The Łask Military Airfield had stood abandoned for the past few years. What little attempts the Brotherhood had previously made to renovate it, paled in comparison to the momentous efforts undertaken to refurbish it in the last couple of weeks. The fortuitous discovery that a blimp once used in a publicity stunt by some shopping chain before the Fall managed to survive stowed away in some rich guy’s private hangar was enough for Ziemkiewicz to organize a luxurious flight over Łódź to celebrate the Brotherhood’s success in overcoming the Blackout.\n\nThe night chosen for the adventure offered particularly clear skies, with the view shrouded only by the usual blanket of smog. The blimp’s gondola had been elegantly decorated to match the occasion and, of course, stocked with a selection of the finest alcohol that the event’s organizers could afford to obtain from smugglers.\n\nAs the event began, Ziemkiewicz, along with the rest of the Brotherhood’s inner circle found himself enjoying the view, perhaps even more so than the booze. The blimp slowly lifted off from the airfield, above the trees, and eventually so high up that they could barely make out the individual engineers down by the hangars. With each kilometer, along the meticulously planned route that would take him straight to Łódź, the sights became more and more brilliant. Pabianice and Ksawerów, both just on the outskirts of the metropolis, seemed to provide the perfect welcome for the upper brass, showing off a miniaturized version of the sight they were about to behold.\n\nSoon enough, there it was. The ultimate fruit of their shared labor was a glistening behemoth with a glow that pierced right through the darkest clouds of smog. Every street, every alleyway, even every highrise was lit up, dazzling the overjoyed spectators and filling them to the brim with the tingling feeling of hope... or maybe that was just the flat champagne from earlier. Each district was more opulent than the last, with the exception of one - Bałuty. Just the thought of that wasteland was enough to make Ziemkiewicz angry, but seeing it from above, engulfed in darkness, was almost soul-crushing. A black hole in the tapestry stretched out before them, souring the triumph right at the climax of the voyage. However, before Ziemkiewicz could stew in his thoughts any longer, he was interrupted by the joyous laughs of his comrades. As he turned to see what the commotion was about, Gadomski approached him with a freshly poured drink in his hand.\n\n- “Didn’t you hear Rafał?..."

belchatow.49.t: "A Moment to Enjoy"
belchatow.49.desc: "“...expect heavy rain tomorrow. Moving over to Bełchatów, the sky is-”\n\nThe weather forecast playing over the radio was rudely interrupted by the sound of a key being pulled out of a car’s ignition. After a very pleasant meeting and a somewhat less spectacular shopping trip, Ziemkiewicz was more than happy to finally be home. Stepping out of his BMW, closely followed by his trusted bodyguard, he grabbed his shopping bags along with a thick dossier of research papers and reports that were lying on the passenger seat next to him.\n\nThe driveway’s gravel crunched beneath his boots, the sound putting him at ease. Ziemkiewicz walked through his house, dumping the papers on a table in the living room so he could read through them later, before continuing out the back to his yard.\n\nTo call his so-called garden bland would be an understatement. Aside from some unmaintained bushes and a yet-to-be-removed tree trunk, there were only a few patches of miserable-looking grass. However, there was one singular thing at the center of the Elder’s attention - his trusty old grill. Lighting it up was like second nature to him. Toss in some good charcoal, add some old newspaper, and watch it burn. Now that everything was set, Ziemkiewicz reached into his shopping bag, pulling out some beer and most importantly, a whole pack of sausages.\n\nAs he loaded them up, he took a seat on a folding chair right next to the grill. As the sausage slowly cooked, Ziemkiewicz stared off, thinking back to the meeting he attended earlier in the day. The board was composed of the Brotherhood’s best chemists and engineers. They presented Ziemkiewicz with a groundbreaking means of producing graphene using the few materials they had available. The Elder didn’t really pay attention to any of the technical mumbo-jumbo, however, his mind was full of ideas as to what the Brotherhood could do with this new wondrous material. Maybe they could create some kind of super-light armor to equip their soldiers with? Why stop there? Why couldn’t they make their soldiers’ entire kits out of this stuff if it’s so light and hardy? Why not create tools, machines, and... and... is that smoke?\n\nZiemkiewicz suddenly snapped out of his daydream. As he frantically looked around to find the source of the smoke, he eventually looked down. The sausage he was just cooking was smoked well past perfection. As a matter of fact, it was nothing more than a charred piece of barely edible meat. After shoving the burnt to a-crisp sausage into the charcoal, where it now belonged, he looked back at his trusted bodyguard and said..."

belchatow.50.desc: "- Gentlemen, analysis! Listen to me, we need to make some changes. The past few days have brought us a tsunami of ideas, and we must capitalize on them. Time is coal! Our scientists are brilliant, our engineers the most hardworking. It's up to us how we combine these potentials. Brotherhood - redefined! Imagine those headlines. And now! Showtime!\n\nAs he spoke, he frantically spread the papers across the board, revealing intricate diagrams and schematics that represented the culmination of countless hours of research and collaboration. Whispers of intrigue swept through the chamber as the Council members leaned in to examine the detailed designs. Ziemkiewicz paced alongside the table, his hands frequently touching the diagrams as if to emphasize their significance.\n\n- With graphene, we can create armors for our soldiers that are virtually impenetrable yet incredibly lightweight. Think of the advantage this would grant us on the battlefield. Our forces would be nigh invulnerable, striking fear into the hearts of our enemies. But that's not all! Imagine vehicles that are faster, stronger, and more agile than anything we've ever seen. Machines that can reshape the very landscape to our advantage, extracting resources more efficiently than any conventional tool ever could!\n\nAs Elder concluded, there was a hushed silence in the chamber. The weight of the possibilities hung in the air, each Council member lost in their thoughts. Warzecha’s piercing eyes gazed into the board, almost as he was already planning his next steps, Janecki writing something in his notebook meticulously, and Gadomski just listening to every word Ziemkiewicz said.\n\n- But first, we must ascend! We need to truly transform ourselves into the heralds of the future, showing no hint of hesitation. Until now, we've tried to justify our actions in every way we could think of, but now we must systematize this. Only ideological validation of our thinking will allow it to endure. Carbonism must become more than just a sentimental slogan thrown around at rallies. It must become our spirit!\n\nAs the deliberations continued, Ziemkiewicz glanced out of a window, the distant glow of the coal mines reminded him of the legacy they had built. The path forward was uncertain, but it was a path worth taking. With a determined nod, he turned his attention back to the Council, ready to lead them into a new era of innovation and greatness."

Arek to his friends. He's been too accustomed to Głowno to just leave, not to mention, his son and daughter weren't ready for the hardships of exile. So, he 'volunteered' to mine. The terms weren't nearly as great as expected, especially since they introduced the temporary 12-hour shifts. But no matter how tough things got, he had to provide for his family. Besides, if Arek's calculations were correct, they should finally be returning to 8 hours workdays roughly about... tomorrow.\n\nWith that piece of motivation in mind, he's been working to his fullest with the knowledge that today was the last time he had spent half his day in the mines. 1/3 of the day wasn't that much better, but hey, you can't have it all.\nBut, Even after 8 hours, the shift just didn't end. The steam whistle didn't sound, despite another hour passing. Eventually, Arek had enough and dropped his pickaxe.\n- What the hell, boss? It's been 10 hours and we're still working. Didn't you hear the news?\n-Arkadiusz Traszka! To me! - the booming voice of his boss, Stanisław Dereszyński roared across the mines.\nSeeing that none of the other miners had joined him in his defiance, Arek complied with the furious call. When he entered Dereszyński's office, his boss's voice was much calmer.\n- What was that Areczek? You better not mention 8-hour shifts ever again. Don't look at me like that, Areczek. You saw the terms of your contract. We are not obliged to inform you about changes in the work hours.\nArek's wrathful eyes softened Dereszyński's tone even more.\n- It's not that I have something against you personally or any of the other miners. It's the Elder's order. We can't afford shorter workdays as we don't have enough manpower in the mines. And I think you're well aware that questioning the work conditions in the open is considered an illegal trade union activity and is punishable by contract termination.\nArek's body language clearly reflected the fear his boss's words inflicted on him.\nDereszyński saw that he had already won.\n- Listen, Areczek. I like you, so we can forget this little accident if you go back to work and never bring this matter up again. Your fellow miners don't need even more work. And they'd have to pick up the slack if we were to fire you.\nArkadiusz wanted to say something in his defense, but he just sighed and got back to work."

But to access them, we must make a difficult choice. We need to seize it, because the machine of progress demands it! Humanism be damned!\n\nZiemkiewicz, seated across the table, shifted uncomfortably in his chair. His gaze bore the weight of the moral dilemma, his hesitation evident to all. How convenient for him.\n- We must consider the cost of such an action. Expelling our people from villages is one thing, we can always move them to cities. But this... this is huge. Where would we redirect them? Bełchatów? Łódź? They can only take so many refugees.\n- We will build additional housings. More construction jobs, more people living in the cities, not spread out across the country like roots - My patience wore thin\n- I’m not sure Łukasz. I would need to see the numbers. And blueprints.\n\nNow he’s suddenly a shining moral compass! But can you see beyond the immediate anguish, the brighter future we could forge? You question the means, but what of the ends? Trapped in the shadows of your own conscience. Could you for a moment fathom the harvest of progress that awaits? You question the path, but what of the destination?\nI can’t take this anymore.\n\n- Elder, your wisdom shapes our deliberations, your insights illuminate our way. Of course, I shall provide any calculations and projects necessary. But I need your consent. And i would need it right now.\n- Łukasz, are you in a hurry somewhere? Don’t worry. This needs to be taken slowly. - Ziemkiewicz's gaze met mine, our eyes locking in a silent duel of convictions. Elder didn’t want to see that i’m about to burst. Or maybe he’s just fucking with me. Either way, I'm not gonna let him humiliate me any longer. I stood up.\n- Rafał, let me remind you, that I won't let you stop this. I always do what’s in the best interest of the Brotherhood and you know it. Now, I'm gonna leave. And then I'll get you all the papers. And finally, you’re gonna sign it.

A quick glance out the window - yes, the train has indeed been brought to a standstill. But this is not Koluszki, or at least not the station. Marcin got off the ground and looked thoroughly at the landscape beyond the window trying to make out his surroundings. The train was standing in an open field - tracts of dead rye stretched to the horizon, looking pitiful in the feeble sunlight that barely broke through the dust and smog. Then, something prickled in Marcin's heart.\n\n'Again,' he thought, 'again we'll be standing for days in the middle of nowhere because of some traffic jam. Surely...'\n\nHis thoughts were interrupted by the hiss of the railbus door opening. The musty air inside the carriage gave way to the smell of soot. The entering conductor shook the dust off his shoulder and spoke:\n\n- You can leave. We will be standing here for a long time.\n\nThe whole carriage breathed a sigh of relief. At Rawa, the knights of the Brotherhood did not let them get off. They said the train could move at any time, but, in the end, they waited for four days within their metal cage. Once upon a time, before the Fall, the journey to Lodz only took a few hours. Back then, even that was considered excessive. Oh, how much he'd give to bring those days back. The passengers, displaced citizens of a now-nameless village in the northeast of the voivodeship, crawled outside, half alive from the fatigue. They quickly scattered across the field, walking one by one between the ears of rye. Marek took a deep breath and let out the dirty air with undisguised relief."

Although they had batons, guns, and an obvious numerical advantage, they did not attack. Like jackals, they waited for the old botanist to finally lose his strength before they strike a swift, but decisive blow. Suddenly, one of the knights broke formation and swung his weapon at Miroslaw. That was exactly what the man was waiting for, breaking the knight's jaw with a quick thrust despite the soldier's helmet. The man quickly settled to the ground. Enraged, the senior paladin charged at the botanist, the rake barely parrying the blow of the metal baton. Accurately judging that the senior botanist won't be able to repel everyone at once, another knight planted a kick in Mirosław's tibia. Although he fell down in pain, he did not scream. The paladin approached the fallen defender of the Arboretum to deliver the final blow. He raised the opening of his helmet. The grimace of rage on his face slowly gave way to wild joy.\n\n- Now you'll regret it, old man! - he shouted and rushed at the aged scholar\nThe latter seized upon the opportunity his enemy's carelessness presented him, and with his foot, corrected the position of the rake lying on the ground. In his frenzied attack, the invader stepped on it, the handle hitting him so fast that he did not even hear the swish of the air - he immediately fell to the ground, unconscious. That was already too much - the whole cloud of Brotherhood members rushed towards Mirosław in unbridled anger. Suddenly, a voice rang out:\n- Stop! - They all turned their heads, seeing their commander.\n-Capture him, but don't kill him. - he said\n\nIt took Mirosław a moment to realize why such an order had been given - Only as he was tied up and forced to watch the Brotherhood soldiers burn, cut, and dig up the entire Rogów Arboretum did he understand - they wanted him to witness the futility his desperate last stand. Break him and his will to fight for good. One night was all it took for the forest he had spent 50 years of his life in to be turned into an open-cast mine. All he could do was weep as his greatest treasure turned to ash."

Dobra, zapomnij. Teraz będzie śmiesznie. Opowiem żart. Co łączy Jana Pawła II i Rafała Ziemkiewicza? Obaj lubią górników. Bo wiesz, górnicy, nieletni, hehehe.\n- Ty idioto, oni prawdopodobnie monitorują i widzą wszystko, co piszesz - wykrzyknęła jego żona. - Usuń to!\n- Uspokój się, to tylko bot. To nie jest tak, że na komputerze są małe sługusy druga strona. Albo nieletni.\n\nTymczasem po drugiej stronie, w ośrodku telekomunikacyjnym Bractwa Węgla, Stanisław Janecki przechadzał się pomiędzy rzędami biurek, przy których skrybowie Bractwa stacjonowali tylko do jednego zadania – odpowiadania na pytania użytkowników zgodnie z ideologią Bractwa. To genialne posunięcie sprawiło, że każda rozmowa z Carbotem (tak nazywał się cały program) była spersonalizowana, ale przede wszystkim kontrolowana.\n\n- Proktor Janecki! - krzyknął jeden ze skrybów. - Mamy sytuację na ulicy Sztygarskiej 21. Obraza przywódcy państwa.\nJanecki natychmiast podszedł do biurka i zerknął na ekran. No cóż, pojawił się joker i to słaby.

Chcę wiedzieć o nim wszystko, gdzie pracuje, gdzie mieszka jego rodzina.\n\nZ triumfalnym wyrazem twarzy Janecki odwrócił się. Jego tajny projekt mający na celu identyfikację wrogów publicznych, reakcjonistów i Wiechowitów przyniósł niewyobrażalne rezultaty. Strzał w dziesiątkę. Kątem oka dostrzegł podniesioną rękę innego skryby. Tym razem chodziło o promowanie ekofaszystowskich kłamstw. Och, to był pracowity dzień."

belchatow.83.desc: "Ever since the Academy of Common Sense opened, it soon filled to the brim with young and fierce students. But what made it so popular? The simplicity? Well, surely, it wasn't just the case of it being the only legal college. Strike the iron while it’s hot they say. The proud Elder surely must have been following this thought when he announced that he was about to become one of the lecturers at the Academy's Bełchatów campus.\n\nIt was Tuesday, 7:30, and the inaugural Metallurgy lecture was about to begin. As students entered the Auditorium, they were greeted by Elder Ziemkiewicz sitting waitingly behind his desk. From the very first minutes, the class devolved into a sleuth of mad ramblings. What was supposed to be a lecture about steel went into an entirely different, incoherent direction with each spoken word. When entering the hall, the students surely noticed mounds of books the Elder surrounded himself with. Unfortunately for them, these texts had nothing to do with Metallurgy or Steel. Known in the Brotherhood as a renowned publicist, Ziemkiewicz brought many of his personal works and began to describe each of them in meticulous detail.\n\nThe students just sat there dumbfounded and listened in, but what else could they do? They were bestowed the honor of having a lecture with the most important person in the entire country, who could put them in prison just with a snap of his fingers. However, not one of them knew how to feel about the spectacle unfolding before their eyes. Whether it was from the fear of interrupting him, pure adoration, or simply tiredness due to the early hour, not a single soul dared to speak.\n\nAfter an hour and a half of what felt like an eternity, the students hurriedly left the hall, each, of course, with a signed copy of one of Ziemkiewicz’s books."

All sorts of wild stories, jokes and retellings. One such among them was told by a worker doing ‘community service’ in the Bełchatów Mines during one of the few breaks they get.\n\n“So here’s how it went, right? Ziemkiewicz was flying his fancy old airship over Bałuty and saw Paweł Lisicki sitting in a green armchair with a jabol in his hand below. He lowered his flight, landed among the ruins, came out and approached the delinquent.\n\n“Hello Rafał, what the fuck are you doing here?”\n\n“I'm flying around, it's a good thing I found you, where do you work?”\n\n“Nowhere.”\n\n“Wouldn't you like to go back to your profession?”\n\n“Why, you're doing great.”\n\n“But we could use you.”\n\n“I don't give a fuck. I'm a pensioner now and I'm fine.”\n\n“Come on, mate, it's going so well without you, think how good it would be with you.”\n\n“And who would I be?”\n\n“Well, editor-in-chief of Do Rzeczy.”\n\n“Now you've got me interested, but I don't want to anymore.”\n\n“But why?”\n\n“I don't want to.”\n\n“You wouldn't have to do anything, I'd write everything, I wrote all your books anyway. You'd just sit on your arse like you do now and that's it.”\n\n“For how much?”\n\n“For conviction. And a beer. And a new book.”\n\n“And all right, what's the harm? Fine. But this book isn't supposed to be the same as last time only with the pages swapped. My brother-in-law read it to me recently and I only just noticed...”\n\n“Ok, the book will be brand new, I promise.””\n\nHowever a guard overheard the poor sap, wrote down a note, passed it on and up the chain of command. The community service soon became longer, and the guard got himself a nice new pair of shoes, with the bonus he received."

belchatow.56.desc: "- Good morning to all citizens of the Brotherhood. My name is Jarosław Jakimowicz, and I welcome you all to the first debate of this kind. We have been approached by the first Wiechowite actually willing to have a civil discussion. Just to be sure, he was thoroughly searched to verify that he didn't have any portable nuclear weapons attached to his clothes. BOOM! - Jakimowicz shouted and shook his hands energetically - Just kidding. Let's hear it for our guests!\nThe camera moved away from Jakimowicz.\n- You know him, you love him, he's our dear Elder's second-in-command, it's Łukasz Warzecha!\nAn applause ensued to welcome Warzecha, who was wearing his best Brotherhood uniform.\n- And here's our unexpected guest - the remorseful eco-fascist - it's Robert Zielonka of Atomice Village.\nThe camera panned to a man with plenty of curly hair, a dirty suit with an armband with a poorly-drawn atom symbol.\nA loud 'Boo!' came from the audience.\nOk, gentlemen - Jakimowicz put an end to the loud disapproval. - First question: Why do you support your causes?\n- I'm a member of the Brotherhood due to the horrors of the atomic holocaust and the tyranny of foreign elites that want to take away our sovereignty under the guise of ecology. - Warzecha began.\n- I've been an enemy of fossil fuels ever since a car with a combustion engine ran over my cat. - 'Zielonka' retorted.\nThe audience laughed.\n- Alright - Jakimowicz interrupted the crowd's reaction once again. - Brother Warzecha, are Wiechowites evil or just misguided?\n- I think they're misguided. Dangerous, but simply misguided. We are, of course, ready to convince them they are wrong. But we can only do that if they're willing to talk with us.\n- Thank you, Brother - Jakimowicz then turned his eye to the alleged Wiechowite. - Are there any more ecologists willing to have a discussion with the Brotherhood?\n- No - the other guest instinctively responded - As far as I'm concerned, I'm the only one who wouldn't shoot a Brotherhood member on sight.\n- Well, what convinced you to come here?\n- I'm a Wiechowite, but I disagree with this whole armed resistance thing.\n- Brother Warzecha, are you also bewildered that the Brotherhood has such kinds of enemies when they do so much good to the Polish nation?\n- Yes - Warzecha nodded - Yes, I am. Especially after the amount of jobs we provided.\n- What about all the deaths in those workplaces? - 'Zielonka' interrupted his interlocutor - In the last month, the casualties in the Rogoźno mines grew exponentially!\n- First of all, I think you mean the ROGÓŹNO mines. Secondly, I just happen to have a graph about this exact topic - Warzecha countered his opponent - as we can see: the deaths in Rogóźno didn't grow as a result of our decision to build the mines.\n- Thank you, gentlemen. That will be all for now. - Jakimowicz turned directly to the camera - And for our dear audience we've got a poll we'd like you answer: The fate of the Wiechowites. Extermination or pacification? We'll continue the debate after the commercials."

belchatow.84.desc: "I heard birds screeching on and on, flying over us, like mine canaries let loose from their cages. They used to serve as a warning for miners, saving many lives in their time. Now they were gone, set free.\nI was precisely such a canary. The world is a mine, just like this cult, this Brotherhood seems to believe. And for over 60 years humankind has been digging too deep, too greedily. If it goes on, we will flood this planet with greenhouse gases and render it unsafe. It's as simple as that, and we screamed about it like a canary would. We the scientists, the activists, the concerned citizens.\n\nSure, in the 70s, the media took our warnings seriously and ran insane cautionary headlines. Coastal cities will be underwater by 2000, and Earth will be uninhabitable by 2020. Climate science was never going to be precise, not with the media exaggerating. And yet, the weather became worse, more fickle. It genuinely got warmer. Soon, as modern climate science predicts, the equator will be uninhabitable. We kept trying to warn the world, but others stopped listening when they realized we weren’t 100% accurate. As if climate calamities had to be punctual and played by our “9 a.m. sharp” rules.\n\nWell, in a way, some took us seriously. So much so that they rounded us up, put bags over our heads, and dumped us here.\n\nI see others alongside me, mainly young men and women. We are pushed off a minibus and we walk, watched by three guards and their guns in what appears to be a huge open-pit mine. A testament to humankind’s dedication to the old ways, even if it ends up killing them. In place of nature, dirt, and death. We march through the epicenter of the Brotherhood’s war on nature, its fanaticism over human life. Ours and that of our children. Others were “optimistic” we were being led to a labor camp. The black guards were silent as we neared our destination.\n\nWe were gathered before a large shaft: There were no ladders nor lighting there, just a huge maw of darkness. One of the guards went up on a pedestal.\n- We gather here to cleanse mankind from its opposition to common sense, its opposition to power and prosperity through reasonless dedication to nature over humanity - I resisted these words as they reached my ears. I've argued against such fanatics for half my life, yet all I ever said ultimately meant nothing. If this is how humankind responds to my warnings... then let this whole mine collapse and may we all die in the destruction to come. I see the guards attempt to push the man before me into the maw, but they find themselves unable to fully throw him in. Suddenly, he speaks:\n- I’ll go willingly, under one condition. Spare us the rest of this droning of his -he says, pointing at the speaker\n- How dare...  - the paladin responds\n- Enough! - the guard cut off their argument, - All right, deal. Let’s get this over with.\nThe condemned man walks confidently ahead and falls, having achieved his life's final victory, albeit a small one. Another one, trembling with fear, is cast into the pit, stumbles, and screams as he falls. My turn now.\n\nNo last words, there were none. For them, there needed to be none. I closed my eyes, and I heard the guard’s hoarse breath over me."

As such, the swelling military quickly found itself lacking senior officers. The generals needed to be both proficient in combat and ideologically motivated. All those requirements were swirling in Rzymkowski's head as one of many interviews he's been conducting approached its end.\n- So, Jacek...\n- Umm, it's Michał, sir.\n- Yes, of course - his mind started drifting away after so many candidates - You've got quite a résumé. You present an almost ideal predisposition to fight for our cause. Almost. Between 2001 and 2006, you've been a member of Newsweek's editorial board. If only you had been as pure as your brother... - the Paladin pointed at Jacek Karnowski, who was being interviewed alongside his twin - Now him we could recruit.\n- Those were different times - Michał began to defend his honor - It was long before the diabolical reign of Tomasz Lis. I've changed and my brother needs me to work effectively. Besides, what kind of Brotherhood would separate brothers?\nRzymkowski wasn't in the mood to argue. And the Brotherhood needed more commanders.\n- Fine. Welcome, Brothers - he shook their hands - You will pledge your loyalty to the Brotherhood in the next week's ceremony.\n- Next!\nOnce the Karnowski twins were gone, another duo of candidates entered. But these lot didn't look anything like brothers.\nThe Head Paladin looked at the list.\n- Ah, Mr. Zychowicz and Mr. Bartosiak. - Time to see if those 'military experts' are really worth their money - What do you bring to the table?\nReal conquest - Zychowicz began - Conquest happening in front of your eyes. But before the next question, I'd like like to give the floor to my colleague, Jacek Bartosiak.\nBefore Rzymkowski could intervene, the geopolitics expert started his disquisition.\n- While the Brotherhood's power projection in the Łódź region, especially in Bełchatów Isthmus, moved your country up in the pecking order, we can't jump to conclusions, but without the New Model Army, it may be a matter of time before your neighbors in the rimlands will say 'I doubt it'.\nDamn, those guys really seem to know their stuff - Rzymkowski thought to himself."

belchatow.77.desc: "When after 6 hours of work, the employees of the newly founded weapons plant in Brzeziny were finally nearing the end of their shift, they were exhausted. The job required utmost precision, after all, they were tasked with producing some of the finest weaponry the Brotherhood has seen to date. For a few days now, they've been perfectly aware of the honor about to be bestowed upon their young yet already accomplished factory. Today, it was to receive the name of one the most accomplished figures in the Brotherhood's history - that of the late paladin Tomasz Sommer, murdered a few years ago in cold blood by ecofascist rebels. Once the workday was over, they were ordered by the management to change into formal attire, tailored specifically for the occasion. The uniforms showcased the region's mining traditions, embellished with industrial symbols and the Brotherhood's coat of arms on the cap. At exactly 4 p.m., Bełchatów's elite, including the guest of honor - Rafał Ziemkiewicz, gathered before a covered-up statue in front of the company's entrance, accompanied by a numerous and highly-trained entourage of guards. As the writer exited his limousine, he quickly composed himself and headed to greet the factory's director - Adam Wiśniewski.\n\nThe renowned industrialist was no stranger to Ziemkiewicz, having been appointed to this post not just due to his experience and knowledge in the subject of firearm production, but also as a personal reward for having saved the leader's life back in 2026. It was then, during Wiśniewski's time as a minor manager in one of the capital's many industrial concerns that he was able to foil an assassination attempt on Ziemkiewicz's life. During the writer’s visit to the factory, Wiśniewski noticed a coworker of his brandishing a gun with the intention to murder the Elder, managing to redirect his arm, and in turn, the bullet, upwards. In the resulting scrap, the industrialist found himself gravely injured, saved from the resulting beating only by the guards’ belated arrival. In the hospital he was visited by nearly the entire upper caste of the Brotherhood, promised a due reward for the incredible feat. He was told the fatherland would never forget his heroism.\n\nThe promise had been kept. He now had the honor of presiding over the grandest opening ceremony in the Brotherhood’s history. Wiśniewski could hardly contain his excitement. Once the initial clamor quieted down, he gave a short speech and ordered the workers to fire a celebratory salvo. Untrained, their vision impaired by the copious amounts of smog in the air, they pressed their triggers, releasing an uncoordinated storm of bullets. One of them, fired by Karol, a laborer barely over the age of twenty, bounced off a nearby chimney, striking the massive head of the centrally placed statue. With a loud thud, it fell to the ground, revealing the image of the late Sommer. The crowd gasped in shock as a hole pierced through the layers of marble, in the same spot as once through the Paladin's cranium. A tense silence ensued as the workers nervously pondered the consequences awaiting them."

Stalowy behemot przypominał kolwerinę na przemysłowej dawce sterydów. Już samymi rozmiarami samo to wystarczyło, aby nawet najtwardsi członkowie Bractwa zakwestionowali swój inżynieryjny zdrowy rozsądek.\nTłum, będący mieszanką inżynierów i urzędników starających się wyglądać poważnie, wpatrywał się w armatę z mieszaniną podziwu i sceptycyzmu.\n- Czy jesteś pewien, że to coś? Zamiast tego nie wyśle nas na Księżyc? - zapytał cicho jeden z nich swojego towarzysza.\n\nLufa armaty, tak duża, że ​​zmieściłby się w niej mały domek, skierowana była groźnie w stronę odległego horyzontu. Widzieli tylko odległy las, przesłonięte zapylonym powietrzem. Napięta cisza ogarnęła scenę, gdy narastało oczekiwanie.\n\n– Ogień w dziurze! – Z ogłuszającym rykiem armata wystrzeliła ładunek. Przez chwilę oczy wszystkich były wpatrzone w horyzont, oczekując eksplozja gdzieś w lesie. Ale rzeczywistość miała inne plany.\n- Przy kuźni... w co celowałeś?! – krzyknął Wysoki Paladyn.\n\nPocisk przeleciał nad wierzchołkami drzew, znacznie dalej, niż ktokolwiek się spodziewał lub planował. Goście spodziewali się wybuchu, ale nie przewidywali ERUPCJI. Coś, co można opisać jedynie jako gigantyczną chmurę grzybów uformowaną na niebie, gdy ziemia zadrżała groźnie. Płomienie i dym wybuchły, tworząc surrealistyczny obraz na szarym niebie, podczas gdy tłum wybuchnął chórem zaskoczonych okrzyków i nerwowego śmiechu, gdy ognista pozostałość uniosła się w górę.\n\nUśmiech Rymkowskiego zmienił się w niewygodny uśmiech, gdy dron obserwował okolicę, ujawnił prawdziwą powagę sytuacji. - Wygląda na to, że za lasem jest mała wioska... a przynajmniej była. Dotarliśmy na stację benzynową – poinformował po kilku chwilach operator. Rzymkowski zwrócił się do swojego oficera propagandy i zapytał:\n- Czy ta wieś przypadkiem nie była nam lojalna?\n- Wcale nie, proszę pana. To była znana siedziba czcicieli atomu – odpowiedział oficer, co było rażącym kłamstwem, bo nawet nie znał nazwy tej osady. Rzymkowski sprawiał wrażenie niewzruszonego czy raczej niezainteresowanego i szybko zwrócił się do widzów z triumfalnym uśmiechem, obwieszczając.\n- WIELKI SUKCES!

It’s like someone turned a trailer truck into a bus. Darkness. Panting and sweat of a few dozen men in leather coats, vests, and helmets. A few lights that flickered on and off. They say they ran on oil from coal liquefaction. All our fuel comes from coal liquefaction. No one dared say otherwise. It made sense too. Good luck getting your hands on raw petrol these days.\n\nEverything made sense. Our roads were never the best, so the whole trailer trembled and shook like crazy. We were the only ones with sound logistics training so we could ferry more of our forces. We were the only ones with common sense, so our plans would always pan out.\n\nThese convictions are why we are driven there. Every squad, including mine, knows their objective. We’ll soon leave this dank place and do our jobs, perfectly tailored to make the most of us and our armored forces. We may not have known each other, but this entire force is one large orchestra. Everyone knows what instrument to play, how, and when. Our violins are guns to press the momentum until the mighty crescendo of our tanks sends the audience ablaze. Ziemkiewicz himself conducts all this. All I have to do is play what’s needed and when.\n\nKnight Daniel, the designated marksman. He shot from every rifle in our arsenal, from VSS to Mosin-Nagant. He’s a man of few notes, delivered right where they make the most impact alone.\n\nKnight Adam: a machine gunner. And an engineer too. He’s so experienced with getting our portable MG’s to work against all odds that we just put him in charge of all our equipment. This experience is also why we put up with his humor, with all the dryness of an African savanna.\n\nSamuel, Igor, and Emil. Soldiers of few words and empty eyes. Maybe they asked too much. Perhaps they were born loners without a need for social niceties. I know Emil has. He shows no care for us, but he cares. This I know. It’s my job to know. They shot with pistols, SMGs, and even carbide cannons. They’re reliable.\n\nThey all know their place in the symphony. And when the truck stops and the sounds of battle surround us, the doors come unlocked. Each of them looks at me, counting on me. Like they’re lost without me. Emil’s eyes look like a dog’s, ready to do anything for me and the Brotherhood. Not knowing how to do anything without me.\n\nThe whistle. The thundering of the boots as others ran out. I was mesmerized by the drumming of those boots. They were the perfect background instrument, necessary in such a song. I got a move on a second before my freezing in place would become insubordination, and my team followed."

With a church right in the center. By now, the whole place was a wreck. Every other street had potholes from artillery fire. Most buildings were at least slightly destroyed. The town was split fifty-fifty between the Brotherhood and the enemy. Indeed, the heaviest fighting was near the church, and its music filled my ears even half a kilometer from it. Our shock troops were assaulting it, hundreds of violins reinforced by the drums of artillery and mortars, making an utter mess out of the wooden church. “The Church is a rock that never falls,” my mother told me. She made it clear she meant Christianity itself, communion with God, for this particular church was falling apart under the devil’s symphony.\n\nAll so that my team and others could conduct an infiltration assault, carving out a path to the supply route of the church's defenders. We’d face weakened resistance thanks to most of their forces focusing on defending the church.\n\nAnd indeed. We stopped, creeping through the remains of a wooden house, spotting the enemy team before they could spot us. We knew what to do - Every door and window was covered by us. The music started as Daniel’s marksman rifle sounded death itself to come for the first enemy. Clean headshot. I wanted to exchange fire and let the music play until another fireteam flanked them and cleared them out, but Adam loaded his machine gun with armor-piercing rounds. He looked at me. I nodded.\n\n“Suppressing fire!”\n\nSamuel, Emil, and Igor unloaded onto them, and Adam’s machine gun, the drumroll, sent the audience in awe of the raw power of inversing the usual role of rifleman and machine gunner. The bullets smashed straight through the wooden skin and flesh of the opposing house, putting holes across the whole house. A quick surge of emotion. Audience in applause. The music plays on, but this stanza is complete. Now Emil and Igor moved up to secure the house, covered by Daniel. One house cleared, moving on. Check the street: Next one appears to be empty. Other teams help us scry the next block, but it’s clear. We trickle across the dirt road and search the house for enemy gunners. All we saw was a family. A granny and two middle-aged men in the basement, cuddling each other, barely noticing us or the rats around them. We let them go and moved on. Just like that, several homes were cleared by different teams of ours. The afternoon turned to sunset sooner than we expected."

We had to secure the perimeter and ambush any enemy supply convoy we came across. Knight Emil spotted an outpost of heavily armored troops. Actual enemy soldiers. As we prepared our instruments to resume the symphony, the silence boiling my blood in anticipation. By now, our armored support should’ve arrived from the south. And then... chaos.\n\n“Corporal Wesel, change of plans! We got a heavy tank dead in the water, half a kilometer south of your position, callsign: Anthracite Mound, over.”\n\nThen, two other squads by our sides commenced an assault on the road. “What? This is a 16-man job. We need support for that!”- I screamed as howling mortar fire descended upon the enemy outpost.\n\n“The others will pin down enemy units to prevent them from hitting our tank. Your orders are to go relieve it now!” - The voice spoke through machine gun fire and screams of other soldiers.\n\nIt wasn’t up to me to decide if the attack continued, but It should have been aborted the moment our tank got pinned down. “On me, we have a tank to save!” - I said and began to march down south, vigilant of any enemies. Further down south, there were fewer buildings and more thickets to hide behind. Frogs croaked. Reeds were abundant. We were entering a swamp. Something rustled, putting the team on high alert -  Daniel watched with his scope where a bird or two flew away. No sign of anyone. There before us was the tank. A hell of a beast made of black steel with dark treads half-sunk in deep mud. And it made sense. This monster must have been way over 70 tons - A square chassis of deep steel, proudly displaying bullet and shell marks. Brotherhood ornaments gave dignity and pride to this gray metal box. It was carefully sculpted and colored crests of the Brotherhood on the front, sides and turret. Its sophistication was mesmerizing, even if tainted by a battle scratch here and there.\n\n“Anthracite Mount, this is Corporal Wesel. We’re thirty meters north of your position.”\n\n“Roger, proceed to establish a perimeter. We will need heavy-duty vehicles to get out of this mud.”\n\n“I can’t have a proper perimeter with one fireteam; we need...”\n\n“AMBUSH!” - Emil’s high-pitched scream pierces my attention, and the entire symphony ceases in my ears. All that remains is Emil’s surprised and scared face, pointing at men in ghillie suits. Knight Emil looked at me as the bullet whizzed by his ear. There was another gunshot.

From the boulder that served as my cover, I could see the AT missile slam into the tank’s turret, making it shake and shudder. Yet the turret still responded with cannon fire. One of the shells struck exactly where one of the muzzle flashes came from. I turned my head as the thunder slammed at the boulder. A crater was all that remained of that enemy.\n\nI commanded Adam to open fire on them, but then another explosion threw me out of my cover. The blast sent me flying,  making me lose my submachine gun. When I came to my senses, I thankfully had little to no wounds, except for some cuts and pretty bad bruises. No one even tried to shoot me, Adam and others were suppressing them well. The tank faced south and laid suppressive fire on the enemies there. Emil used that to disappear into the reeds. I feared Emil would lose himself in the bog, he always feared swamps.\n\n“We can’t take much more! Machine gun down!” - It would appear that the AT hit penetrated the tank’s turret. At the same time my submachine gun singed in Emil’s hands. In his finest hour, I saw one, two men fall, and another two reposition: Adam nailed one of them, and Daniel headshot the AT gunner. The western fireteam went down. Emil ran to cover before the southern fireteam got him and looked at me. Like a dog who just chased wolves from a sheep. The mania. The smile. Was he proud of what he did?\n\nIn place of Emil, a mortar shell expands into a flash and a fountain of bloody mess. Where he stood, he was hit point blank. The flash spared me the worst of this spectacle. Body parts flew high up in the smoke. Where there was just a moment ago my bravest man, there was only mud and blood. When the dust settled, I still saw him and the flash. The flash...\n\nEverything else became a blur. I saw flashes from the buildings to the west. “Take cover at the tank!” I heard someone say. Was it my voice? As Igor and Daniel rushed to the tank, I saw a flash, and Igor fell. Just when Daniel’s about to make it, another flash, and he falls. I got dragged towards the tank and walked, held up by arms that must’ve belonged to Adam, and once we were hiding by the tank, I came to my senses.\n\n“Requesting smoke screen at... A10, 7-9! Say again, A10, 7-9!”\n\n“What are you doing?” - Adam asked as another mortar shell thundered, too far to do anything to us."

belchatow.108.t: "Your Violins are Guns..."
belchatow.108.desc: "“More enemies incoming from the East. Get out of there now!” - the dispatch roared.\n\n“They’re coming...” - Adam said. Almost on cue, we took fire from the east. I ran like hell towards a run-down shack between me and the southern fireteam.\n\nThe tank rocked again. I’m sure it can’t take much more of these mortar hits, and near instantly, I was shrouded in smoke. More bullets whizzed by my ear. Was Adam okay? I kept going regardless. Where’s my gun? No matter: I still had a pistol. Before the smoke covered us, I saw another AT gunner move into position. If I emerged from the shack, I would be close enough. The shack's wood and the dark door quickly appeared in the smoke, and I entered.\n\nI quickly took cover as yellow blazing snakes burst out of the shattered windows. Two, three vipers of flame danced before and above me. I accepted the most profound possible breath and crawled, on and on, the heat to my left tormenting me, the flames taunting me. Where did they get a flamethrower from?\n\nThe music played, and the flames of hell danced, and as my nose slowly filled with embers, I realized the chaos with which this symphony was led. Where are Adam and Samuel?I didn’t have time to dwell on that. My mind wonders, but my body doesn’t care. No one knows me. No one cares about a single violoncello.\n\nThe exit was near. A run-down door, one kick, and it will come crumbling down. Like a door to heaven, a doorway I didn’t deserve after playing in the Devil’s Symphony for so long. I crawled, begging God for salvation from the lake of flames behind me. A second death. And I haven’t even gone through the first one. I stood up with unholy strength. With a pistol in hand, I kicked in the door, and smoke blew right behind me. A cellist straight out of hell, I saw the surprised faces of four enemies aiming at me. I pointed at one with my pistol, the one with the rocket launcher. Point and shoot. My last notes, against their accords.\n\nAs I shot, so did they, and I felt bullets poke against my body armor, against my arms and legs. Not pokes. Deep, painful pierces. Turns out even the best body armor does little against assault rifles at close range. I kept shooting.\n\nThe AT gunner exploded in the same way Emil did. I stumbled ahead, an empty pistol falling from my hands. Everything was dizzy again. Sounds extend and distort around me.\n\nThe tank... I saw it. It’s damaged, but it stands. The MG somehow still fired. The turret spewed MG fire as well. And the Brotherhood symbols... I saw them in red. I saw everything in red. In place of its emblem, a pentagram. A great fear shuddered through me. I recall my grandmother warning me against temptations when I was little. Greed, pride, lust. Those were the big three. I did well against them. And yet...\n\nForgive me, Lord.\n\nMy soul left my wreck of a body, uncaring of the soon-to-be wreck of a tank, this whole music. My notes in it were played. I followed the conductor’s lead. And still, I had the gall to beg for mercy right after my instrument served as a gun..."

belchatow.80.t: "Sparks of Innovation"
belchatow.80.desc: "All major arms manufacturers dreamed of this contract. But in the end, the assignment went to a recycling plant. The Steam Combine Citadel was tasked with creating a groundbreaking weapon, a power armor that would turn a Brotherhood soldier into a titan on the battlefield. Perhaps it was precisely at the moment of the bidding, seemingly rigged, that the fate of the entire project was decided.\n\nThe Citadel was a rather dingy factory that processed scrap. So, where were they going to get the materials that would allow them to build a technologically advanced exoskeleton requiring many resources that were not available in scrap yards? This aspect, along with many others relating to project costs, was not disclosed to the public. The team of scientists under the leadership of engineer Antoni Tarkowski was to achieve the impossible. They certainly had enthusiasm and eagerness, and they were also supported by a military company from the Łask Paladins battalion, which was to test their achievements.\n\nWith each blueprint drafted and prototype assembled, their aspirations seemed just a heartbeat away. Prototype after prototype, the engineers' hopes were forged and shattered. Each trial revealed weaknesses: power imbalances, mechanical flaws, and suits too heavy for even the strongest of the Brotherhood's members. Finally, when all problems seemed to be fixed, it was time for the final trial.\n- Graphene core reinitialized, full system analysis... all readings nominal. Can you move, sergeant? - asked engineer Tarkowski\n- It's a bit uncomfortable here, and my groin is itching. How am I supposed to scratch it, huh doc? - Sergeant Majecki, to whom the honor of conducting the final phase of testing fell mocked.\n- Sergeant, please...behave yourself\n- Alright, alright, let's go! - With energetic movement, the sergeant set the entire apparatus encasing his body in motion.\n- It's alive! And it executes all movements very quickly... too quickly. - During an attempt to rotate, only a dull crunch could be heard. In a second, the sergeant bid farewell to his life. Broken neck. Instant death. Dozens of prototypes were in vain. Not to mention the personnel losses.\n\nEverything the scientists tried seemed not to work. Every time they thought the suit would function flawlessly, just when they breathed a sigh of relief, a critical error occurred. The armor stopped working or the tester got injured. Hundreds of fixes and minor tweaks often deepened the errors rather than eliminating them. In the end, the solution was prosaically simple, but it disqualified the entire concept of the armor serving as an effective battlefield solution because movements made by its wearer could not be relayed in optimal time.\n\nEvery other scenario carried the risk of user mutilation, lack of balance, or a critical mechanical failure. But the power armor's imperfections weren't the science team's biggest problem. How were they going to present their failure at the evaluation meeting without being sent to the darkest depths of the Bełchatów mine?"
belchatow.80.a: "Every failure brings us closer to success."

belchatow.81.t: "Echoes of Failure"
belchatow.81.desc: "Engineer Tarkowski's hands were trembling. His deputy, Engineer Majer, lit cigarette after cigarette, also visibly stressed. They were waiting for a meeting with Sentinel Warzecha, during which they were to present the results of the power armor construction project.\n\n- They won't be pleased, damn it, they won't. At best, we'll lose our jobs. At worst, our lives - lamented Majer. Łukasz Warzecha entered the room flanked by two guards. His expression clearly radiated dissatisfaction, but then again, that seemed to be the norm for him. He opened a neatly organized folder filled with documents and scrutinized the engineers with his gaze. His penetrating stare sent a chill down the scientists' spines, and upon seeing the terror in their eyes, Warzecha smirked slightly.\n\n- Gentlemen - he began slowly - you know very well how much of our budget was allocated to this project. So, I want you to tell me what a magnificent technological breakthrough your endeavor was and how you miraculously overcame all the odds to ensure a bright future for our Brotherhood. Well, speak up!\n- Your Paladinishness, we have two pieces of news. One good and one bad - Tarkowski began with an uneasy tone.\n- Start with the bad.\n- It doesn't work.\n- And the good one?\n- We've built it.\n- Ahh...finally. Wait a moment, how can it not work? How. Can. It. Not. Work? - Warzecha's tone was no longer passive-aggressive. He started to resemble a shark ready to tear its prey apart - Are you trying to tell me that you've wasted so many of the Brotherhood's precious resources on a piece of shit THAT DOESN'T WORK?\n- Sir, please, it’s not what you think! The suit won’t be combat-ready, but it still can be used for other things! Like, like... ermm...I don’t know, parades?\nWarzecha pretended not to hear that. He burst into loud laughter, and while still cracking up, he turned to his two guards.\n\n- Wonderful, truly! Knights, throw them into the dungeons - he said, nonchalantly, as if ordering his morning coffee. The knights, not waiting for the scientists to get up, pulled them out of the room and, amid cries of protest and pleading for mercy, dragged them to the nearest truck. The principle that messengers should not be punished meant nothing here. On the other hand, they were responsible for the project and its failure. It's just a pity that it was destined for failure from the start, and the scientists wasted their careers throwing themselves at the impossible. Another day passed in the Brotherhood of Coal with grandiose projects attempted to be implemented without thinking and without success. And yet more lives thrown into the oblivion of Bełchatów's mines."

belchatow.82.desc: "- Farewell, cruel world! I shall never again behold the sun's radiance...- engineer Majer lamented, surrounded by the darkness of the Bełchatów mine.\n- If only you could still see the sun through this Egyptian darkness above... just shut up and dig.\nThe engineers' situation was far from ideal. Without trial, without judgment, forgotten by all, their destiny was to perish in the gloom of the tunnels, digging for coal that had long been mined, except perhaps for the very smallest of insignificant lumps. In a moment, guards were expected to arrive to assess how much work the prisoners had done. From a distance, their shouts, full of threats to throw anyone who didn't meet their quota into the furnace, were already audible. This wasn't going to be some kind of paid vacation.\nA moment later, a figure stood behind the scientists. It was but one person. They turned around and found themselves astonished beyond words.\n\n- Good evening, gentlemen! I've been searching everywhere for you, but it seems great minds think alike! - it was Rafał Ziemkiewicz, the Elder of the Brotherhood of Coal himself. What was he doing here, one could hardly guess, and it was equally hard to determine whether his tone was well-hidden sarcasm or if he genuinely thought that they had come here on a tour. It wouldn't be far from the truth to say that Ziemkiewicz's lack of awareness was the dominant marker of the absurdity of this situation.\n- Listen to me for a moment! I've come up with a brilliant concept. What if we take your power armor suits and equip them with mining tools, turning a miner into a tank that will dig coal like crazy!\n\nThe engineers looked at each other, seriously wondering if he was mocking them. But perhaps this was an opportunity to reduce their (non-existent) sentence.\n- That's a brilliant idea, Your Excellency! We believe we can assist you in adapting your idea, if only you could, well, get us out of here.\n- Get you out? Ah. Yes. I will get you out of this darkness, don't worry. I already have the title of the book in mind. Relax, yes, I will mention you in the foreword. Then you will emerge from the shadows. Or maybe I'll draw up the technical details first? Yes, yes, I can manage that. Alright, I must go. See you! - Ziemkiewicz darted toward the exit like a child summoned for dinner. A storm of ideas raged in his head. He had to put them down on paper before they slipped away from him.\n\nAfter a moment, two out-of-breath guards caught up with him and insisted he go with them to the exit. There, Sentinel Warzecha was already waiting, staring incredulously at the Elder and saying:\n- Rafał, what the hell are you doing? Going into the mine alone without an escort?! - Warzecha exploded.\n- Łukasz, it's okay. What was supposed to happen to me there, anyway? There's an elevator. Listen, we have to go. I have a brilliant idea. But first, I need to write it down. Do you have any paper?"

Yes, Warzecha has been a thorn in their side for a long time.\n- And what, my friend, do you propose we do about this?\n\nAfter a careful glance at his surroundings to ensure their privacy, Janecki activated his handheld ComPAN terminal that displayed a confidential situation report from Warzecha's network.\n- Take a look - Janecki urged, pointing to the intricate messages. - This idiot shouldn’t have set his password as ‘coal123’. Here is Warzecha's second report. His genius plans are crumbling, and he's trying to conceal it from the Council. The situation is many times worse than he tries to present it. Heads will roll. Probably ours to start with.\n\nGadomski leaned in to study the projections, a mixture of apprehension and intrigue flickering across his features. Janecki's tone grew firmer, a glint of determination visible in his eyes.\n- Warzecha has exposed his ineptitude. Ziemkiewicz falls further into his delusions with each passing day, and Rzymkowski is an incompetent brute who only wants to see things explode.\n- But who, Stasiek? Who can we rally behind as a beacon of change? We’re not really leadership material - Gadomski weighed his thoughts carefully. A subtle smile tugged at Janecki's lips.\n- Our dear Roksana - he said, his tone measured - She possesses charisma, a connection to the youth. We can mold her loyalty to our cause. We'll shape her allegiance. She will become the embodiment of change, while we do our work from behind the scenes\n\nGadomski's brow furrowed, betraying his doubt.\n- Can we truly guarantee her loyalty? Can we be sure she will be open to this? And besides...we'll have to take care of Rzymkowski\n- She will comply. And don’t you worry about the High Paladin. I can create chaos in the army's ranks with a single snap of my fingers. I’ll take care of this - Janecki replied confidently.\n\nAs the conversation concludes, the shadows of the massive industrial complex bear witness to their whispered conspiracies, setting in motion a chain of events that could reshape the destiny of the Brotherhood of Coal."

belchatow.58.desc: "One of the few entertainments for the youth in the Brotherhood was the opportunity to attend Roksana Węgiel's concert. Despite holding a significant position within the Brotherhood's apparatus, she continued to travel the country with her concert tours. It was undoubtedly an escape from reality for her, but also a chance to reach a large number of people, primarily the youth. They saw in her a hope for a better tomorrow, just as the Brotherhood's propaganda machine meticulously planned.\n\nHowever, this time, as Roksana concluded her concert in Łódź, she had even more concerns weighing on her mind. She had been drawn into a spiral of events that were slowly becoming overwhelming. She lacked certainty whether she was truly meant to be the one to change the fate of this land. But she forgot the impact her persona had on human hearts. It wasn't just a concert; it was a gathering of souls inspired to work together for the betterment of the nation's future. The cheers of the crowd still echoed in her ears, a roar of celebration in her honor. In that moment, the energy emitted by her fans could power a city through the entire night. Roksana, as the recipient of this wave of enthusiasm, was deeply moved, yet she also felt a sense of obligation.\n\n- Thank you all for being here tonight - her voice rang out, carrying a mix of gratitude and determination - Music has the power to unite us, to ignite our passions and remind us of what we stand for. If not for it, we would be empty. It fills us with hope and motivation to rise up every morning and fight day and night for our future!\n\nThe sea of faces stared up at her, a chorus of eager anticipation. It has never happened before that Roksana began a political speech after her concert. That was something new. Something changed.\n\n- We are living in a time of change - she continued, her words resonating with the aspirations. - A time when the shadows of the past cling to us, but we have the power to shape a future that belongs to us. We're here tonight not just to celebrate music but to stand together as a generation that refuses to be meat for their machines! Blood’s on the wall brothers and sisters! I call upon each and every one of you to join hands with me in a journey that will transform our Brotherhood. We are the future, and we have the power to be the change we seek!\n\nAs the applause and cheers resounded, it seemed to shake the very foundations of the world around them. Roksana's eyes met the eyes of the youth before her - a generation that was no longer content with complacency. They were the force that would reshape the destiny of the Brotherhood."

Gadomski's heart pounded like the footsteps of history while Janecki's resolve held firm. A gentle knock echoed, followed by the door creaking open, revealing the young songstress adorned in her concert attire.\n\n- Roksana, we've come with a proposition - began Gadomski, his voice a mix of urgency and sincerity. - You've witnessed the turmoil that plagues our government. The Brotherhood needs a new direction, a leader who can guide us towards a better future. You know we need a change. You can be that change.\nRoksana's expression remained guarded, contemplative. She knew sooner or later, someone may want to involve her into internal quarrels but she didn’t want to pick any sides.\n\n- Why should I trust you? Why should I involve myself in those petty battles you’re fighting amongst yourselves?\nJanecki, calm as ever, without saying a word just handed her folder with crucial files regarding the state of the country.\n- This is the evidence of Ziemkiewicz's and Warzecha’s true actions, of the manipulations that have led our nation astray. With your support, we can bring this truth to light - continued Gadomski\n- And what role do you see me playing in all of this? What guarantees do I have? - Roksana was still hesitating. This time Janecki replied.\n- You represent the voice of the youth. You symbolize their hopes, their dreams. We’re old. We can’t reform this country without you. You could be the face of the future, and we would be there to advise you. Without forcing. And guarantees? This is my file I have on you. There isn’t that much there, you always were a pinnacle of Brotherhood greatness. Take it, it’s original, I don't have any copies. Consider this a good start to our friendship.\n\nRoksana's fingers traced the edge of her stage costume as she contemplated the path before her. With a final deep breath, she looked at Gadomski and Janecki with determination in her eyes.\n- My loyalty lies with the people, not with any faction. If you truly want change, I will help you. But you must prove it to me if I need to believe you.\n\nGadomski and Janecki exchanged a meaningful glance, understanding the weight of Roksana's conditions.

I’ll be a new man in Slovakia by the time the Brotherhood figures out I'm gone.\nThe man looked old, worn out, but similarly well-clothed. He sipped chocolate milk, warm and perfect for this weather.\n- Let’s start with what your Brotherhood meant for you, Where did you work?\n- I was a trainee at their officer school.\n- Can you tell me more about your schooling there?\n- Mostly fun, but very... sectarian. Ended abruptly.\n- What did you do there?\n- We do study tactics. Doctrine. Sun Tzu Sundays, Clauzewitz Mondays. But on Tuesdays... we pray. That’s what it is. Mantras. We listen to Ziemkiewicz’s tirades to the point we know them better than the Paladins do. And we praise. We weren’t just repeating normal praises, we had to constantly come up with new litanies about the Elder's genius. Sometimes, you’d have people brainstorming for hours in silence so they don’t risk a forbidden idea being uttered. Anytime there was a good concept thrown around, it was just a ripoff of old hymns. Who wants to hear “God save the Elder?” “Welcome, Brother?” I thought the officers were supposed to be creative. But, it was clear. Detention for not saluting, punishment for not praising: They all placed priority on drilling us into the belief in their ideals to a fault. You not only fail for flunking a test, you also fail for trying to reuse a meal tray. It all went to the trash -  it’s better to get a new one than to risk drawing their ire. Those in my class who suggested the most insane of ideas got top marks. I, for one, flunked, and am now on the refuge. I’s the only reason I’m telling you all this. You wanna know how I flunked?\n- Of course.\n- I told the head of the faculty that power is power. I meant that firepower is firepower no matter where it comes from, but he clearly must've heard that phrase from Roxi’s cohorts elsewhere. And so, he thought I was hers. Frankly, I’m surprised I’m still alive. But yeah. I still laugh about this privately.\n- And who’s this Roxi you're talking about?\n- You wanna know my opinion?

belchatow.61.desc: "Łukasz remembered the Black List. It was shorter, more thorough, and well-investigated. The Brotherhood was small back then and easy to pull in any direction. If it strayed, you shook the trees wherever there were problems, culled the rotten fruit, and you were done. Today, we are many times that size, having more resources and manpower at our disposal than ever before. And every last root is diseased. Filled with rot. Add in the chaos of refugees disrupting our operations, and you've got a recipe for disaster unless you manage to restore discipline quickly. This was not a complete list - it covered only the Bełchatów capital region. There were many others like him, hundreds of clerks under Warzecha, condemning traitors and ecologists, real or imagined. His boss had to review all those lists, but he was just one man. The clerk had no doubts he’d just sign off on whatever he gave him unless it happened to contain his name (or maybe not even then). Life and death were in his hands. But he was a simple, albeit erudite, man. He was only here to do a job and serve the Brotherhood. Getting any ideas beyond that meant risking getting a leadership position or the revisionist label: He was not nearly devious enough for either. But sending men off to their deaths? Why not. It was so easy. He never had to look them in the eye, he who swung the sword. It was obey and kill or die. He knew what happened to his predecessor. And though he never had to hear the last words or consider their families... perhaps few things would change if he had to. His survival meant everything. And these are nothing but names.\n\nScraps of data are attached to constructs intended to represent human beings. And he looks through them all, judging their loyalty. Rafał here, he was seen talking to Roxi exactly once, back when he was a member of the Carbonari. So what? Many did. Now he’s an exemplary military officer who tries to keep everything in order, like the clerk. He’s off the hook. On the other hand, his direct superior, Damian, was always spotted at night alone when he was supposed to be asleep. Why? That’s right - to covertly converse with revisionists or maybe Wiechowite spies. He knew just the shaft for that man. So to the list, he goes.\n\nToday, a hundred names, judged against the reports about their deeds, have been sent to the proverbial shaft. The clerk never had to worry about what would happen to them; it’s not his job. Another hundred were exonerated. Had he been too lenient, his job would be on the line. Warzecha had neither patience nor mercy. He felt regret, but a sense of survival overrode it. A man in black would show up in his office, and he’d join the list. Feed it. Or join it.\n\n- Sir Beiar? On behalf of Elder Ziemkiewicz, you’re under arrest.\nThe previously calm demeanor instantly turned into a look of utter terror. - What for?\n- It appears your list was a bit too generous. We can’t survive with this many proscriptions in the capital region. You’ve gone too far. Besides, we have good people turning to treason because you let the last list leak too early.\n- I did not... - then he realized it was over.\n- Please, I did everything Warzecha ever asked. Tortured, broke, sold others out, what more do...\n- We know. That's why you’ll die quickly and with dignity."

Pątnów and Turów are on fire. Several blocks of Skawina EC were blown up. Probable cause: a terrorist attack. We're down to Bełchatów and several modest plants of limited capacity - listed the officer.\nA shadow of concern passed over those gathered. Everything they had built seemed to crumble like a house of cards with a single sweep of a hand.\n- What about Opole and Rybnik? - asked Warzecha. He appeared the calmest among them, but that was merely his calculating demeanor and ruthlessness speaking through him.\n- Opole is operating at half of the regular efficiency and Rybnik is scrambling for the last tonnes of coal they can find, but they won't be able to go on for very long - replied the officer.\n\nZiemkiewicz sat with his head bowed, unwilling to look his subordinates in the eyes. But was it truly his fault? He didn't know what was worse - the guilt of having destroyed the country or the realization that he had no control over the actions of his subordinates.\nEvery subsequent decision will set loose a spiral of consequences...\n\n- Where is Rzymkowski with his Guard?! Recall him immediately to the capital, we must secure the core of our country against the worst to come - Ziemkiewicz snapped out of his stupor - Barricade the streets leading to the main offices, ration energy and transfer it to critical departments, secure all food sources, and distribute portions only to essential personnel. We didn't build up our industrial might for years just to have it dismantled in two days by some fucking yokels!\nAfter these words, the Elder sank into his leather chair, visibly drained, as if the outburst had cost him considerable effort. He choked, feeling a lack of breath in his lungs. Seeing this, Warzecha handed him an inhaler and with a calm, mischievous smile, said to Ziemkiewicz:"

And that meant more paperwork, which in turn meant more people amassing in the hospital wing, which in turn meant even more deaths.\n\nThis vicious cycle wouldn't have stopped accelerating, had it not been interrupted by the hospital's director, two armed Brotherhood members, and the town's funeral service members entering the department, escorting those oldest and most sickly out of the hospital, confiscating their IDs and handing them over to the workers stuck in the urology wing, with the director nonchalantly ordering the staff desperately attempting to tend to the patients to: ''prepare the death documents for those escorted and the next 50 people sent to their wing - no point in keeping these people around if we cannot save them anyway.''"

belchatow.62.desc: "Over all of Bełchatów, the sky is clear. Which is quite peculiar, as in the most polluted city in Europe, such a scenario is almost unheard of. But for Roksana Węgiel, today the sun shines with a mythical gleam, and the wind carries the specter of changes. If everything goes according to plan, that is. Rzymkowski's Guard hasn't been redirected to Bełchatów; the main units are at the front.\n\nTwo battalions of Carbonarii are to secure the city, the next two - the Power Plant. Minimal resistance is expected in the case of the former, while the latter is anticipated to be a piece of cake. Orders have been given, and despite Janecki's assurances that everything is under control, Roksana, a bundle of nerves, feels like she hasn't been this stressed since her first concert before an audience. But she can't back down now; they expect her to hold her head high and be resolute, qualities desirable in a leader. She started to hum quietly to herself, taking a deep breath. Someone is burning tires. It's warm after all! Or perhaps the moment's temperature has just taken over, and emotions are igniting her from within.\n\nA message came through the radio. Roksana, accompanied by her Carbonarii, drove towards the Ministry of Mining building, where Elder Ziemkiewicz and Sentinel Warzecha were currently situated. Inside, young soldiers were bustling about, pushing officials and disarming guards at every turn. They ascended to the fifth floor by elevator, and a rather unusual, yet quite satisfying scene lay before their eyes.\n- Shut up, or you'll get a pivot on the rimland in a second - Paladin Bartosiak warned Sentinel Warzecha, leading him in the crosshairs of his rifle. Roksana smiled as they passed them by towards the office from which loud screams were emanating. It was Rafał Ziemkiewicz, shouting at the guards who were watching over him, berating them as reactionary dwarfs of wiechowszczyzna. He fell silent for a moment upon seeing Roksana.\n\n- Elder Ziemkiewicz, on behalf of the Interim Council of the Brotherhood of Coal, you are under arrest for betraying the ideals of the state - Roksana recited in a single breath.\n- Sweet summer child, are you threatening me?! - Ziemkiewicz erupted.\n- The Council will decide your fate.\n- I AM THE COUNCIL - with this cry, Ziemkiewicz tried to lunge at the guards, but after two steps, he fell, barely breathing. He was a depleted echo of what was once a formidable leader. Nothing remained for him but to submit to the will of the stronger."

belchatow.63.desc: "The concept of getting rid of political enemies couldn't have been more ominous than the one that originated in the mind of Sentinel Warzecha. He was aware of Gadomski and Janecki's conspiracy, as the former had no skill in covering his tracks. They planned to use the Carbonarii and Roksana Węgiel to stage a coup. Fools, in a few hours, they will be apprehended by soldiers and brought to interrogation. Fortunately, Rzymkowski managed to arrive in Bełchatów just in time; otherwise, this whole situation could have ended badly.\n\nCoincidentally, at 9 p.m., Roksana was scheduled to perform a concert for the top officers of the Carbonarii. And the concert will proceed without disruption. At this moment, Roksana will conclude her final song, using smoke emitters to intensify the atmosphere. It will be an unforgettable spectacle.\n\nInside, a truly stifling atmosphere prevailed. The room wasn't large, but all the key officers of the Carbonarii were present. Yet Roksana didn't appear enthusiastic, despite her efforts to mask it with her radiant smile. The final song, and back to reality. However, this reality turned out to be hazy. The audience seemed affected as well. What kind of concert is it when everyone... falls asleep?\n\nAs Roksana gently slumped to the floor, soldiers entered the room wearing gas masks. They tied up everyone and carried them out of the building. Their fate was clear at that moment. The deepest dungeons of the mine awaited them. The chance of ever seeing daylight again was very slim. The apparatus of repression would ensure they never even received a fair trial.\n\n- Are you coming with me to visit some more friends of the state? - Sentinel Warzecha addressed Head Paladin Rzymkowski. Act two was about to begin. As the door opened for each of the people labeled as a reactionist, an immediate shot rang out, without words, without trial. Warzecha was standing close enough that the splatters of blood painted his face a crimson mess as well. He was the one who knocked. Upon returning to the Ministry building, as if nothing had happened, he went to his office. Without cleaning his face, he ordered Ziemkiewicz to be summoned. However, Ziemkiewicz, drowsy in his robe and blissful ignorance, was greatly irritated by someone disturbing him at night. In a nonchalant manner, he simply asked Warzecha,\n- Is that blood? Where did it come from?"

belchatow.65.desc: "The Brotherhood Court, a room situated in the renovated grand building of the Estakada Mall, was bursting at the seams. The "Trial of Three", as the press vibrantly wrote about this event, was again on the lips of all residents of Bełchatów.\nThis time, in an ironic twist of events, those who once pronounced judgments now find themselves on the accused bench. There are three of them: Łukasz Warzecha, Rafał Ziemkiewicz, and Tomasz Rzymkowski, who was tried in absentia. The newly formed Council of the Brotherhood wanted to leave no illusions about the end of the era of catastrophic governance and the need to hold the architects of this nightmarish creation called the Brotherhood of Coal accountable.\n\nRzymkowski's trial began with the presentation of numerous examples of embezzlement of funds for absurd armament projects, such as Koala tanks or the Holy Barbara cannons. The main charges were war crimes and involvement in political purges. Rzymkowski was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment, with an arrest warrant issued in his name.\n\nIronically, Ziemkiewicz's trial did not constitute the epicenter of the event. Mitigating circumstances were recognized, as there was a lack of consistent evidence that Ziemkiewicz's actions had any real impact on the Brotherhood's policies. Propagandistically, he was a pivotal figure, but due to his health (and mental state), he was sent to a retirement home in Świdnica with no possibility of leaving the facility and left under constant supervision. Eventually, the time had come for the reckoning of Sentinel Warzecha. Senior Paladin Gadomski took the floor.\n\n- Your Honor, esteemed members of the Council, and all present, we bring forth this case with heavy hearts, seeking truth and justice. I ask Proctor Janecki to present the charges.\nProctor Janecki rises, his gaze locked onto Warzecha, ready to destroy him once and for all.\n- Exhibit A: Secret reports detailing the unchecked expansion of mining operations without proper humanitarian assessments leading to displacement and death of hundreds of thousands of people...\n- Exhibit B: Confidential correspondence showcasing neglect in implementing safeguards, resulting in irreparable damage to the land.\n- Exhibit C: Classified minutes of meetings where concerns raised by experts were disregarded for the sake of expedience and profit.\nSuddenly, the sound of wheels fills the room as a wheelbarrow, pushed by council members, enters the chamber. It is laden with folders containing yet more documents. Proctor Janecki points to the wheelbarrow\n- Exhibit D: A comprehensive compilation of reports, data, and correspondence. A tangible representation of the weight of responsibility held by Sentinel Warzecha together with the names of every Polish citizen executed by his order and documents proving he was behind every political death..."

belchatow.66.t: "Fuming Road"
belchatow.66.desc: ""What has she done?!" - Rzymkowski exploded in anger upon hearing the news of the incumbent Elder Rafał Ziemkiewicz's removal from power. When the information reached him, he was stationed in the borderlands, hundreds of kilometers away from the seat of power, and time was not on his side.\n- That traitor... she wouldn't dare commit such an act of barbarism had the Guard been there to secure the capital.\n\nWithin an hour, an impulsive decision was made.\n- We ride to Bełchatów. For war.\nThe Brotherhood's foundation shuddered as Rzymkowski's convoy advanced, an iron behemoth heading straight for the capital city to reclaim control.\n\nHowever, fate is a fickle mistress. The roar of engines and the crunch of gravel came to an abrupt halt as fuel reserves plummeted. In this moment of irony, Rzymkowski's frustration could be felt by even the lowliest soldier, as the Paladin's carefully crafted veneer of calmness began to slip:\n- Fucking machines, fucking luck, fucking world - he muttered, his voice raw with anger - JANECKI! Where are my goddamn fuel reserves?! You sent them to fucking nowhere! He knew... he always knows. Another traitor! - Rzymkowski kept shouting curses into the sky, as the convoy ground to a halt in an obscure village known as Zakościele. They hadn't yet managed to enter the territory of the former Łódzkie voivodeship, having been stopped right before the administrative border.\n\nA sense of urgency overtook the convoy as the officers desperately attempted to find a working solution. But the looming phantoms were not just those of mechanical failure. Unseen eyes watched their every move, and out of the shadows, Carbonarii soldiers observed, their faces determined. As the night fell, the youthful soldiers quickly made their move. There were no poetic declarations, just action. The Brotherhood's future hung in the balance as they ambushed Rzymkowski's immobilized convoy. Their leader, with a glint of defiance in his eyes, shouted plainly:\n- High Paladin! We’ve come here for justice!\nWith those words, the night's heavy air was pierced by gunfire, and the scene quickly turned chaotic.\nCaught by surprise, Rzymkowski's forces retaliated fiercely, a symphony of gunfire ringing out. Yet, the Carbonarii proved agile and strategic, outmaneuvering their opponents and slowly encroaching on the perimeter of the defenders. Amidst the chaos, the commander found himself face-to-face with one of the insurgents, his expression determined yet defiant. A brief struggle followed, eventually ending with Rzymkowski's capture. Defeated, he was no longer a man suited for the fight. The Brotherhood's iron grip seemed to slip, if only for a moment, as he was led away by a fresh-faced youth who had sought to defend their vision of a different future.\n\nAs the night quieted once more, the village of Zakościele held its secrets close, the echoes of the struggle lingering in the air, a testament to the Brotherhood's fractured state."

They were barely burning anything, just enough to maintain the pretense of still working. He was talking to Gabriel without turning his face off the screens, which showed minimal power consumption.\n- No, but think about it: We can print notes that say we owe them coal that is yet to come. They’ll believe we’re a coal power plant; we at least get our weekly shipments done on paper. So we make them trade their stuff for those papers, then they'll wait for the coal if they have to; we essentially tax them!\n- Nobody’s gonna buy that. You think the people around here are dumb enough to fall for such a scheme?\n- I prefer the term: Emulation of contemporary global finances. Look, what do you think paper money is? It’s a piece of paper that maybe, just maybe, is backed by gold, but it isn’t. It’s backed by the Dollar, which is backed by gold! And who’s to say they even have enough gold for all their dollars? That’s exactly what we’re doing: We might have coal, we might not have coal, but if people believe you have coal, you can make your own money that says you owe them some, and they'll give you stuff for it!\n- So we’ll sell people notes that say we owe them coal we don’t have...\n- And maybe coal will arrive, and then we can cash them out. Most won’t sell those bills... to us.\n- And if they do?\n- Then we'll become refugees, just like the others. The thing is, we’ll be loaded refugees, unlike every other sucker taking flight.\n- Well, don’t look at me. I’d rather contribute by keeping this facility running so you bastards get to hoodwink people out of their goods all day\n- And that is why we love you, Iwan. I’ll tell Jan and Jacek, and they’ll start a marketing campaign for our very own Coal Bills!\n- But what happens if the coal mines catch on to the idea?\n- That’s where Hanna comes in. She’ll buy as much coal as she can from them. Miners are all dissidents, criminals, and suckers: By the time they learn of our scheme, we’ll be off to Slovakia, richer than God himself."

Their healthcare would not hold on, and there would be two kinds of people: Refugees and the dead. Dehydration. Flooding. Storm. Drought. We’d be a drop in the sea and maybe save one in a hundred. The people of those equatorial nations would gaze at us, drowned and dried out alike, with accusing eyes. Why did we let this happen?\n\nSo when I accepted an invitation from war-torn Poland, reporting that their nation’s healthcare was overloaded, I thought I was dodging a bullet. A particularly deranged civil war tore Poland apart. Still, it wasn’t nearly as affected by climate change. Nothing could prepare me for what was to come, however.\n\nIt’s one thing to be invited by an organization called the “Brotherhood of Coal” - as far as spawns of national collapses went, I've seen crazier names. It’s another to see what they have done to their land. The earth seemed to be an unholy mixture of increasingly depressing shades of grey. The sky was clouded but not cloudy: It was all smog.\n- Are these clouds all smog from power plants? - I asked.\n- Yes, it’s all Bełchatów power plant, mightier than ever. - My guard answered.\n- You realize that... - I was about to go off about pollution and possible lung issues, let alone climate change, but...\n\n- Global warming? Be that as it may, our prosperity, industry, and common sense are paramount. Everyone else is expendable\n\nI got a gnawing feeling not to ask the guard anything else. We arrived at the hospital: A half-ruined tenement that isn’t fit to treat even the most minute of health issues. They had to resort to converting apartments into observation rooms. The reception was in a tent outside the apartment building. I gave them my name and the Doctors Without Borders credentials. “Number 59” - the clerk replied and sent me on my way. I asked the guard:\n- What did she mean?\n- Apartment number. - he replied - Just go to apartment 59. The door should be open\n\nBewildered, I took my bag and set out, climbing the derelict, rotten concrete stairs. No one even repainted them. I had visited Poland once - a city where the apartments were as pretty as in Paris. But here... it was a nightmare, incomparably worse than even the worst third-world country he had witnessed. Cracks, formless concrete without facade, weird graffiti - he felt taunted. It would have been terrifying if not for the company of other medics rushing up and down. I enter the pandemonium, wandering aimlessly until I see a run-down door with the number 59. I walk in, hesitant."

All on run-down stretchers, not even a proper bed. A man in the bedroom, a child in the bathroom, an old woman in the living room. Each of them coughed, but they seemed tired and half-conscious.\nI ran up to the oldest of the patients. Thankfully, there were some files under his bed. Dirty sheets of barely coherent information. My guard translated them for me quickly. Symptoms all align with lung poisoning from substances that had no business being in the air, at least not if the power plants indiscriminately burning fossil fuels were equipped with even basic filters... so it seems they didn’t even do that. Why? What’s the point of purposefully...\n\nPacing around, I step on something squishy. A rat. There was a rat under my shoe. I squeaked like a schoolgirl and jumped back. I broke that thing's neck. I see another rat - dead, ensnared in a mouse trap. I scream again, squeamish like I always was.\n- Everything okay? - The guard barged in and asked. Then he laughed heartily.\n- How in the... FUCK, am I supposed to work in a hospital FULL OF RATS?! - my terror boiled into anger. I have worked in some squalid conditions before, but this took the cake.\n- This place is disgusting! I keep working here, and I guarantee my patients get twice as sick! I want to do something about the rats, and I want it done yesterday!\n- Hey! You’re lucky they brought you a full week’s supply. Over here, we never get enough food to go around. Every day, people go hungry.\nI shuddered. We were supposed to assess the situation and assist. And as it turned out, they can’t even provide us basic sanitation and food. I dared not even ask about the sanitation here. I’d have to find out myself.\n- So treat those rats like... extra food for your patients! I can show you how to cook a rat. Hell, I’ll trade you my rations for any rat burgers you’ll make. Don’t worry, it’s easy. As for the patients, you get us diagnoses, and we’ll get you the right meds.\nI shudder at the sheer tragic comedy of it all. The guard’s gallows humor, his smile as despairing as it is jovial.\n- Just go. Sorry for being rude. Let me diagnose the patients and ensure the rats don’t get to them. Then I’ll be back with a shopping list of necessary pills”\n- He saluted and went away. He realized I had a lot to get used to. My heart ached at the idea of leaving the patients in a rat-infested room. But I persisted. Without me, it’d get even worse.\n\nI took essential readings from the half-asleep, delirious patients. They talked, and they were friendly and cooperative. 	Severely malnourished though... I threw the dead rats into a bag and re-armed the rat traps. Then I set some more in every crevice of the building. I wanted to get them all. In the evening, I took the rats to the guard I had previously spoken to. He cooked them with me, and I ate them for supper. It was... much better than anticipated. Tonight, the patients ate my ration. I couldn’t sleep. I just wrote down what I had witnessed."

Often the invitees were simply members of the ruling class, lower-level authorities, bribed scientists, or businessmen. Worthless gibberish was to be expected then. Usually, the viewers would switch to station two and prefer to get drunk watching a documentary about coal mines in Australia or Chile than to listen to a tiring propaganda tube at the end of their day.\n\nThe mood in the studio was different this time. A completely unknown personality entered the coal-black room. Wojciech, a miner watching the show, silenced his son playing under the TV. He tilted his head slightly in surprise. In front of the journalist sat an Asian man, elegantly dressed but quite surprised by the whole situation.\n\n- Marysia! Come here! The Chinese man is on the show. - The miner called his wife. His parents also showed up, filling the small apartment the family has inhabited for three generations.\n\n- Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Paladins and other honorable guests. -  The speaker began - Tonight, we want to present you with an extraordinary inventor from the Far East. Mister... - He had to look at the notes. - Mister Zhang Huang from Beijing. The inventor of SMOG BRICKS! Yes, You heard it right, but please, Mr.Huang, tell us all about it.\n\n- Now... - Thick, poorly translated subtitles appeared at the bottom of the screen - We can utilize smog to help build comfortable apartments for employees where a large workforce is needed. At first, this project was received with skepticism in your state. You don't like recycling from what I've learned. - The guest and journalist both chuckled. - But the minuscule amount of energy it takes to make these bricks convinced your investors.\n\n- After all, you just have to change the state of matter. - The speaker vigorously pointed out the obvious to the viewers at home. - So... How is the project going?\n\n- It's great. The first factory was established in Bełchatów and can already produce bricks, hollow bricks, and other similar types of prefabricated materials. I hope this will quickly improve the housing situation in your prosperous country.\nThe miner briefly turned down the TV\n\n-Did you hear that? - He looked at his wife. -Maybe we'll get that assignment at last.\n\nShe smiled slightly."

They frequently show the Chinese visionary, who now basks in fame alongside the most outstanding scientists and paladins of the coal cult, but Maria didn't care. For her, the important thing is that she might finally enjoy life with her family, free of squalor. After years of cramped living conditions, her son had a dream room of his own, and she and her husband had peace of mind with their in-laws not around.\n\n- Mom! I scored two goals! - A scream resonated in the corridor. - We played as Paladins, and Franek and Kamil were Żydzewiaks! - The child happily ran into the small, grey kitchen made of tiles from an admixture of smog dust.

You know you can't play in the rain without a full outfit! Why don't you think? Why don't you think at all?!\n\nThe boy started to cry and quickly ran to the bathroom. He knew what could happen if his quick-to-anger father noticed.\n\nAs she sat down tiredly on a stool pressed against the wall, specks of dust fell off it as if priming hadn't strengthened them enough. She started smoking recently. Apparently, it's healthy and soothes the nerves. She fiddled with the cigarette in her hand, wondering if everything was alright. She lit it up.

The Chinese inventor had long since disappeared from state television and the miner didn't want to see much of this nonsense anyway. He's been stuck on the couch for three days. He had some sort of lung infection, the doctor said it was probably caused by rotten canned vegetables or some other biohazard. However, it will not be a restful time.\n\nIt was late, he had fallen asleep, and the TV was screening white noise. Maria has been exhausted for a few weeks. Her son's illness does not let her sleep at night, and the additional new problem with her husband only overwhelmed her. For several days, he stayed in bed with some rash and very bad pneumonia. The doctor said he had to go to the hospital and assured her that the new carbotherapy would definitely help. But she is scared. She keeps believing everyone, and that only makes things worse. Remorse breaks through the fear, she can't stand it, and she has to smoke.\n\nRecently, ambulances of the Brotherhood have been coming to the blocks quite often. The old neighbor died a few days ago, and now they're carrying out a man on a stretcher again. He was an old drunk, that was all she remembered about him.\n\nThe man woke up with a sharp cough.

Or even more, to my parents, I know it's far from here, but you'll find a job...\n\n- Are you crazy? Have you lost your mind?! - With the last of his strength, he got up from the couch and looked her straight in the eyes. - What do you think it is? After all this hard work, now that we have our apartment, you want to move to the countryside? With all those green anarchists and bandits?\n\nHe reached for a glass. - Just... stop talking like that.

In a way, their situation perfectly mirrors ours - a state barely keeping itself afloat, constantly pushed down by Western machinations. They have little to give us except the lifeblood of their country - potatoes. Normally we'd laugh them off for daring to suggest such a pathetically unbalanced deal, but the sad reality is - our people are starving and the damn plants might be able to make a difference.\n\nNext, came the Cubans. Their offer is quite simple - the luxury of our energy for the luxury of their cigars. It's been a long time since the Brotherhood was able to enjoy any display of wealth or even any product of considerable quality and the elites are growing restless. Being able to smoke the finest tobacco the world has to offer would surely calm them down.\n\nWhile both proposals sound enticing, our surplus is only large enough to accept one.

Through a fortunate series of events, she had managed to rise to the very top. Of course, she didn't achieve it alone. Most likely, she would never have wanted to do it had she not been practically pushed into action. The specter of the one who thrust her onto the frontlines of the political battlefield never left her thoughts. She didn't want to become a puppet; serve as the Eldress only to be cast aside by the shadows of the government at the first possible opportunity, as happened with Ziemkiewicz. She had to be clever. Years of activity within the Carbonarii had certainly given her invaluable experience in navigating the Brotherhood's structures, but she wasn't prepared to do it on such a grand scale, deciding the fate of millions.\n\nNow, she walks through the abandoned Elderbunker in Wieliczka, seeking inspiration, perhaps answers. Answers to the question that's been nagging her for the past few weeks – how did the country collapse so dramatically? In her desperation, she looked for anything that could help her avoid the fate of her predecessor. The grandiosity with which the former salt mine had been transformed into a fortified stronghold and headquarters brought her into a contemplative state. Everywhere she looked stood symbols of the Brotherhood, grandiose stained glass images celebrating industrial progress, and propaganda posters that surely every member of the ruling caste must have treated with a sense of irony. Ziemkiewicz's office, which she found in the deepest depths of the bunker, was cluttered with scattered notes, sketches taped to every piece of furniture, an artistic vision of another megatank there, a cross-section of a gigantic factory here. She picked up a short note, which seemed to be Ziemkiewicz's musings for another book that would never see the light of day.\n\n- Warzecha was right - she read in the note - If the imperative of our Brotherhood is governance, if we, as sovereigns, can only guarantee the absolute triumph of the new industrial revolution, then we must, MUST - even by force, adapt the entire society to this vision. Leaving even a seed of uncertainty will allow it to sprout and, like weeds, crack the concrete, undermining the system from within.\n\nRoksana discarded the paper with distaste. So, her most terrifying suspicion was true after all. There was nothing ironic or opportunistic in these messages. At what point did they decide that this was the way forward? Nothing surprising. Only a person indoctrinated to such an extent can impose the same will on everyone else.

One day he was teaching his class of disinterested students, the next - he was contacted by the Brotherhood's agents and asked to hold a conference and a lecture to the High Council itself. It was dangerous, but the state of his salary made him desperate. Why did they choose him? Was it because they knew he wouldn't deny such a profitable offer? Maybe he's finally received some long-due recognition. Or have the other experts already been exterminated to cover up the Brotherhood's mistreatment of the environment? Speaking of the environment, he's been hearing that the Brotherhood wants to be more sustainable in the long run. But he thought it was just a propaganda stunt. Yet when the agents contacted him, they asked for the lecture's topic to be about the alternative use of organic-rich sedimentary rocks. He was snapped out of his thoughts when Eldress Roksana Wegiel and her ministers entered the conference room.\n- Gentlemen, I'd like to introduce you to Professor Włodzimierz Czarny, who agreed to present us with even more new ways of obtaining fuel. - the Eldress introduced him with her pearly smile.\n- Well, to begin with, there are many types of coal. From peat to cannel coal, all have unique properties. They emerge as a result of plant matter being buried faster than it could decay. If it wasn't for the time this process takes one could consider it a renewable energy source - he was trying to sell them the idea of mixing the traditional carbon-based rocks with ecology - But we certainly don't have 400 million years to spare.\nThe council chuckled - all besides the minister of the interior, Stanisław Janecki\n- Now, the most intuitive replacement for bituminous coal and lignite would be charcoal. While not a sedentary rock, it should align well with the Brotherhood's code.\n- We already know that Mr. Czarny. - Janecki interrupted him - We use charcoal even as a grill fuel. We already know all of that. Is there nothing else?\nCzarny and Janecki were giving each other stern looks.\n- Right - the chemistry teacher began, hiding his irritation - What if you didn't have to get rid of coal at all?\nNow the whole council was listening to him with undivided attention.\n- What if I told you about a method that will combine using coal as a fuel source with lesser damage to the environment? The gasification of coal - the main topic of this lecture - is a method long known to man. For example, it had been used as fuel for street lights in the 19th century. You can still see them in Wrocław, for example. By mixing coal with oxygen, air, or steam at very high temperatures without letting combustion occur, you can eventually produce hydrogen. This method decreases the level of pollutants by around 20%. This can... This can, with enough improvements, reduce emissions almost to zero by further implementing carbon capture technologies the West has developed. Thus, we can combine the Black Gold of Poland with the agenda of Eldress Węgiel - he paused for a second - So, what do you think?\nThe Eldress started clapping. And the rest of the council followed."

belchatow.70.t: "Ścieki to Nysa, Nysa to ścieki"
belchatow.70.desc: "- We're starting another episode of the Nysa Film Chronicle. Today, we'll talk about a new investment by our benevolent Brotherhood in Lake Nyskie. Additionally, we'll visit the nearby SynthIndustria facilities, which experienced record-breaking productivity in recent weeks, and they've even introduced a new plant mascot - Mr. Polymer. We'll also discuss the conversion of allotment areas into housing for industrial complex workers in the city's vicinity.\n\n- The Brotherhood's Silesian Chapter has undertaken one of its largest investments in the area to date, following a program aimed at reducing pollution in the regions most threatened by environmental collapse. To achieve this, massive concrete dams have been erected on Lake Nyskie to completely regulate the inflow and outflow of the reservoir. The construction of a large sewage treatment plant is underway at the outflow site, but for now, the work is progressing in intervals, frequently interrupted by protests, mainly from a local radical organization known as the Light Side of the Force, which attempts to block all progress and attack the tirelessly operating transports that are trying to pump sewage from the area and accumulate it in Lake Nysa. The entire process is a long-term project, and in the future, the lake itself will be purified. But for now, to alleviate pressure, it must serve as a reservoir for the worst of the sewage. It's also the first investment in Nysa that ecologists aren't vehemently protesting against. Unfortunately, they're either no longer alive or have fled the country. The Paladin-Commissar of the Silesian Region expressed it this way:\n\n- This investment is primarily a plan for the future. We see the evergrowing heaps of pollution that afflict our country. Just last week, a massive wave of sewage overflowed from the Vistula River near Niepołomice, eroding areas inhabited by civilians, leading to a catastrophe in the region and the deaths of many people. Accumulating pollutants in a few key locations will give us much-needed breathing space. It's hard to hide that sometimes the situation within our country is just like that of those poor souls in Niepołomice, just a few centimeters above the level of crap.\n\n- Despite the obstacles, the builders at Lake Nyskie are looking forward to a better future that has gradually begun to shine brighter with the recent change in the highest echelons of power. And now, onto the next part of the program: who is the mysterious Master Weapons Dealer, and what connections does he have to Nysa?"

belchatow.89.t: "Reclaiming the Narrative"
belchatow.89.desc: "As the sun began to cast long shadows across the city of Konin, the newsroom at the heart of the Brotherhood's regional capital was abuzz with subdued energy. Journalists hunched over their desks, clattering on typewriters and shuffling through papers. Among them was Marek Kardasz, a diligent journalist known for his eloquence and meticulous research. Yet, today, his usual confidence was tainted with a hint of apprehension.\n\nMarek had a story burning in his pocket, one he'd spent weeks researching, investigating, and crafting with an intensity that blurred the lines between passion and obsession. The subject? The smog-choked skies and environmental degradation that had become hallmarks of the Brotherhood's industrial might. He knew it was risky, coming dangerously close to criticizing the very institution he lived under, and the Brotherhood didn't take lightly to any kind of scrutiny.\n\nBut we have a different regime now, right? One much more lenient. There have already been numerous investigations regarding climate and pollution, so maybe now would be a good time to pursue this topic at all costs. The article could mark a turning point, a beacon of change for the uninformed populace, but it could also be his downfall.\n\nA stern-looking man guarded the entrance to the editor's office, a censor whose duty was to ensure that the content produced aligned with the Brotherhood's ideals. Marek took a deep breath and knocked on the door, feeling his heart race.\n- Enter - a voice called from inside.\nMarek pushed the door open and came in, the censor's gaze drilling him like an x-ray, dissecting his every intention. He placed the manuscript on the editor's desk, his fingers brushing the pages with a mix of anticipation and unease.\n- I've brought the article, sir. It's about the.. environmental concerns that have been plaguing the Brotherhood with a detailed analysis of their effects on the Konin region.\nThe editor picked up the manuscript, scanning its contents with a discerning eye. Marek held his breath, his palms dampening. The editor looked up, a hint of surprise visible in his eyes\n- You don’t say... and it even includes a critical analysis of how the Brotherhood's policies have contributed to these issues.\nMarek’s heart raced, the sensation akin to a roller coaster's steep drop flushing through him every second. Was he about to be praised or locked up forever? The editor reached for a stamp, imprinted with the words "Approved for Publication," and pressed it onto the manuscript.\n\nHow? Why? Is this a trick? These questions were not meant to have answers. Just a few months ago, the same censor would dismiss anything hinting at problems, no matter how slight. He would even discard an entire piece for merely mentioning the color green. Times are changing, yet he remains the chief editor. And now he lets material that would normally mark the end of my career through? Without even heavily redacting it first? There's nothing like a consistent approach to life. But orders are orders. It doesn't matter. Time to be a true journalist.\n\nI’m gonna win so many awards with this..."

belchatow.90.t: "Business as Unusual"
belchatow.90.desc: "The Miners March painted the landscape with a sea of synchronized footsteps, a visual symphony of unity. In the midst of the collective fervor, two comrades, Grzegorz and Jacek, walked shoulder to shoulder. Their faces, etched with the weariness of coal dust and endless labor, harbored a mixture of hope and skepticism. It’s been a long time since people voluntarily marched on the streets of Polish cities in support of something greater than themselves.\n\n- Grzesiek - Jacek began, his voice bearing the undertones of camaraderie, - can you actually believe it? The Brotherhood taking a new direction, all those promises of prosperity and change.\n- Promises, Jacek? We've heard enough of those over the years, haven't we? - Grzegorz cast a sidelong glance at his friend, his brows furrowing beneath the shadow of his helmet. Jacek let out a chuckle that held the weight of their shared history.\n- True, true. But this time, they say, it's different. We're not just workers; we're the ‘architects of a new era.’ They're offering us higher positions, important roles within the administration. It's a chance for us to be a part of all of this.\n\nAs they walked, the banners of the Brotherhood fluttering overhead, Grzegorz's gaze shifted towards the horizon, his thoughts a lively tapestry of contemplation.\n- A vision - he mused - and the illusion of progress.\n- But progress isn't just a word anymore, my friend. They say with these positions comes something else, something we've not seen in a while. - Jacek's voice lowered to a conspiratorial whisper\n- And what could that possibly be? - Grzegorz's curiosity was piqued\n- Money, Grzegorz. Actual, real earnings, beyond the ration cards and empty speeches. They're giving us a chance to line our pockets - Jacek's eyes gleamed mischievously. A moment of stunned silence hung in the air before Grzegorz burst into laughter, his voice mingling with the rhythmic beat of the march.\n- So what, we're becoming the Brotherhood of Coin? I like the sound of that better, you know.\n\nJacek's laughter joined Grzegorz's, the shared irony of their situation resonating deep within them. As they marched on, side by side, the contradictions and complexities of their reality seemed to intertwine. The Brotherhood, once a bastion of indoctrinated hardliners, was now embracing pragmatism in pursuit of its dreams. And so, beneath the weight of their helmets, beneath the coal-blackened sky, Grzegorz and Jacek walked – hopeful, skeptical, and united in their quest for a future that was both promising and uncertain."

belchatow.91.desc: "A sudden flash blinded Tomasz. His eyes, adapted to the darkness of the deepest Silesian mines, were not prepared for the brightness of the TV studio. Sent to the coal mines a year ago for distributing leaflets written by the universally banned climatologist Marcin Popkiewicz, he now sat dressed in a suit next to the rest of his similarly clad fellow prisoners.\n- Welcome to our new program titled 'The Zone of Dialogue', where views and opinions on the most important events at home and abroad meet... - a female voice, clearly with years of media training, said with perfect enunciation.\nTomasz finally opened his eyelids. In front of him stood Magdalena Ogórek, wearing a gray-green dress. Behind her sat a dozen or so officers of the Brotherhood, all in identical uniforms with carefully maintained, gentle, blank smiles on their faces.\n- It's finally happened. The mine in Rogóźno has been forced to close down due to unprofitability...\n\nTomasz was stunned, he was not yet fully conscious - our guests are already in the studio... the head of the Brotherhood's mission in (...), and finally, representatives of the common sense environmentalists to whom we are about to give the floor. Mr Tomasz, what do you think of the mine closure? Did the Eldress make a good or bad decision? Many voices are in favor of this action, what is your opinion as an expert and a person concerned about the welfare of Polish men and women?\n\nTomasz took a deep breath, looked around, and quickly recalled the whip of the foreman on his back."

belchatow.92.desc: "- I would have never thought that my darkest visions would become reality. That my activities would be labeled as the greatest curse brought upon this country. It might seem that all warnings ended up working in reverse, and I myself got caught up in the whirlwind of some sick ideological fight that long exceeded mere journalistic disputes. Protocols of the Atomic Crusade, Wiechowszczyzna. It's nice to be recognized, just a pity that as a public enemy number one.\n\nThe plane carrying Jakub Wiech was slowly approaching its landing at the military airport in Łask. The view of Poland from above, once a green land, was daunting. Many would think it couldn't possibly be the same planet, as the landscape in many places more closely resembled that of the moon. Flying machines had to be equipped with powerful radars and lights just to be able to navigate through the smog-filled air at all.\n\nCould this be a trap? Such a thought often crossed Jakub's mind after he received an invitation from the new Chairwoman of the Brotherhood's Council. She asked him to come back in order to help with the transition from Ziemkiewicz's disastrous politics currently killing the country. But if this seemingly innocent person was actually a political manipulator, there might not be anything left of Poland to save.\n\nThey landed. He wasn't a pope, yet he instinctively wanted to kiss the soil of the homeland he returned to after years of exile. The second reflex was to take a breath of fresh air. But after a few seconds of reflection, he remembered he still valued his life. He put on a mask and noticed that a few armed soldiers were heading in his direction. For a brief moment, fear engulfed him completely. So this is how he dies? Through his own naivety? However, he saw a familiar figure at the forefront of the procession. Certainly not one of his friends, but at least someone he'd label a colleague in the same profession.\n\nPaladin Gadomski approached Wiech, saluted, and with a smile, extended his hand to greet him. Jakub reciprocated the handshake and finally relaxed a bit.\n- Welcome, Brother Jakub. Eldress Węgiel sends her regards and is pleased that you accepted her offer. Come with us. There is much work to be done."

belchatow.93.desc: "Roksana Węgiel, the Eldress of the Brotherhood of Coal was enjoying her morning coffee. The rising sun was beautifully illuminating the clearing not far from her manor house. The Eldress was fully taking in her well-deserved vacation. The newly united country was already in such a state that it could manage without the interference of its leader, at least for a while. Maybe for a week, maybe for two... Roksana didn't want to think about that now. Surely they would let her know if anything bad happened. And now... now she could devote herself to more mundane matters. The Eldress closed her eyes, put her bare feet up on the table, and spontaneously hummed the melody of one of her old songs - written at a time when everything seemed simpler. Her peace of mind wasn't meant to last, however, as Roksana was snapped out of her pleasant lethargy by the whistle of the kettle.\n- Jesus. - she hissed and sprang from her seat.\n\nThe water always boiled at the worst time. Unfortunately, the boiler installed in her dacha was incapable of heating water for the morning bath and Poland's leader was forced to wash herself in a bowl. Nobody knew why the boiler was so weak; the experts shrugged their arms and Roksana Węgiel could only grit her teeth. Suddenly, the phone rang. The Eldress switched off the kettle and rushed anxiously to answer, expecting some bad news from Bełchatów.\n- Hello, this is Klara Sobieraj.- A warm, feminine voice rang through the receiver.\n- Hello, what is it?\n- I'm calling about the " Clean Powiat" program offering subsidies for and installation of photovoltaic panels. Are you by any chance interested?\n\nRoksana was ready to exclaim that she does not agree to be recorded but was able to bite her tongue at the last second. She looked at the green meadow, the forest in the distance, and took a deep breath. The whole journey to the top of the leadership ladder flashed before her eyes. She felt her chest grow hot. The Eldress let the air out with a hiss, smiled, and pouted:"

belchatow.94.desc: "Amidst the intricate tunnels of the Elder's bunker in Wieliczka, echoes of footsteps seemed to whisper a change of fate.\n- You shall stay here, in Wieliczka - announced Sentinel Warzecha - Here, you will find a peaceful and secure environment. You will have all the comforts you need. You can reflect, write, and engage with your thoughts. The stresses of leadership have undoubtedly taken their toll on your health.\n- Obviously, I’m not a youngster anymore, and yes, *cough* perhaps a bit slower but I’m still sharp and *cough* capable of handling everything! I don’t *cough*..don’t *cough* *cough*\n\nZiemkiewicz's heart pounded, the realization dawning upon him. The Elderbunker was a secluded place, created solely for the purpose of being a peaceful abode, an oasis offering escape from the world. But in his current state of mind, it felt like a gilded cage. As he opened his mouth to continue his protest, another voice emerged from the shadows, its familiar sound having etched itself deep into the writer's mind over the Council's many meetings.\n- Fear not, Rafał - said Proctor Janecki, his tone soothing. - Sentinel Warzecha will take the reins of governance in your absence. He will ensure that the Brotherhood thrives and prospers. Until you return of course.\n\nA mixture of anger and frustration welled up within Ziemkiewicz. The Council's words were carefully chosen, a velvet glove masking an iron fist. He felt trapped, cornered by those he had once considered allies.\n- Rest assured - Warzecha added - your voice will still matter. Your wisdom will continue to guide us, even from afar. You can call us any time and we will pass any crucial information directly to you.\n\nZiemkiewicz's gaze hardened. He had been outmaneuvered, his influence diminished, and his power usurped. But his fire had not been extinguished. As the councilmembers withdrew to finalize the arrangements, the Elder stood in the dim chamber, his fists clenched. The walls seemed to close in around him, and he felt once again, that he was out of breath.\n\nIn the depths of the Elderbunker in Wieliczka, Ziemkiewicz would be faced with imposed solitude, and as the days passed, the ink on his pages would carry the weight of his determination. Of course, if he manages to hold onto his sanity."

Except for salt. - The supply officer recited the day's agenda to the chef in his mechanical voice.\n- Why is salt any different? Ah... right. Salt doesn't grow in gardens. Does anyone up there have any idea how I'm supposed to make a balanced meal plan that won't kill the Elder without any source of vitamins and minerals? - the head chef sighed in frustration.\n- I'm not here to discuss, I'm here to throw all plants into the incineration chamber. Let's pack’em.\nZiemkiewicz's personal chef had a tough task when it came to enduring the whims of both the man himself and the rest of the lunatics who are coming up with increasingly absurd initiatives. Forbid this because it's green, forbid that because it's red. You might as well tell everyone to eat coal and dirt. Our leader must have really been sentenced to death by the Council because such a diet would knock down even a bull.\n\nRafał Ziemkiewicz sat at the table as usual, engrossed in his own notes, having a quiet but fierce conversation with himself. Apparently, he had lost this debate, as he had the expression of a sulking child who didn't get the toy he wanted from the store. The chef, seeing this, knew he was putting his very existence at risk, yet he rolled in with a cart of food to the dining hall. The Elder immediately pushed aside his notebook and eagerly observed what awaited him. With an energetic motion, he uncovered the first dish.\n\n- What the hell is this?! - Ziemkiewicz burst out.\n- A well-done steak - the chef replied. In truth, it was heavily overdone.\n- This is raw! Please fry it for god’s sake! And what's the second one?\n- Ice soup...with salt.\n- What...the...fuck? - Ziemkiewicz looked like he saw an alien.\n- New directives from upstairs, sir. Didn't have anything else in the cellar. Let me fix that steak for you!\nChef Radosław stepped away with the plate of meat, leaving the stunned Elder to ponder the consequences of his own actions. The cook was wondering what to put into the pot next. His most common thought was to dip his own head in there and set the gas to maximum. No wonder every other cook didn’t last any longer than a month here in this god-forsaken place. If there exists a hell for chefs, it surely is here."

Bit by bit, I fell apart, but in the anesthetic bliss, it mattered little.\n\nWhat am I doing here? The light is too bright. The bed was stiff and felt like a slab. The green overalls, green sheets, green clothes, and white masks of the doctors... are even they doctors? What did they give me? Memories are fading... no, getting disconnected from my body. I feel numb. I remember nothing, I have nothing... I am nothing. No wonder I signed up to offer up my lifeless husk. I saw the IV tube and the bags attached to it. 'MORPHINE,' one bag read. Another... 'BETA-B'. What is beta-b?! My mind is a disjointed mess, recalling things without context or meaning. It's the one thing that saves me from the unbearable present, the feeling of hopeless doom. The kind where you'll stop at nothing to not even stave it off, but distract yourself, pretend you're fighting it, pretend you have a chance. Keep yourself busy until the end. Somehow, I felt this was exactly what we all were doing here.\n\nA black chamber awaited me as I was carried from the stretcher to a black slab. There were a few tubes and a monstrous machine attached to them. It smelled of... oil? I... remember that smell. And suddenly, a memory connected: I am a refinery engineer in Łódź. I produce petrol via coal liquefaction. The oil pours into what appears to be a cauldron, making it stir and bubble up, resulting in a terrible odor. No memory clicks: This smell could be anything. It begins. What begins? I don't remember. But something does. I remain conscious. Vaguely, I feel them cutting me open. What for? A lung transplant? I'm too numb to move and see. But I do feel my stomach. I think it churns out food. I feel it decompress, I feel it... no more?\n\nAnd then it's suddenly full. A liquid fills it again, and it feels fuller than ever. It's all extremely vague and numb thanks to the morphine. There are convulsions. Through the fog, I feel them. Every single bit of my body is shaking. I hear distant shouts, and two doctors don't even help. They just quickly write something down. The pain is now everything. Everything hurts, especially the veins. Every organ shakes. So much pain through the numbness... I'm burning from within! As it spreads, the effects of the morphine escalate, the pain and morphine in eternal battle. Everything boils. Everything hurts. I close my eyes and see the sun, my wings burning, and the fall, unending fall into the blue... I see pictures of some family, someone's childhood, a dog, a refuge, and then initiation into some kind of Brotherhood. I felt no connection with anything. No point nor reason why I was seeing them. A kaleidoscope of someone's life? Whose? I have no life. I don't remember having one, ever... All I remember is despair, fear, and a way out. A voluntary suicide for science - being powered by pure coal. I remember the relief when I signed up. Why did I fear and despair? Now the smell, the vicious smell, that wasn't coal. That was mere petrol. So I wasn't even given that honor. They just put me on an experiment with liquefied coal. The next thing they'll try is making a nuclear stomach, and hopefully, it all blows up. Why do I feel a tinge of fear when I say nuclear, though...\n\nAll is lost. I never even realized what I had lost. But I'm relieved. All this, all the death and despair... not my problem anymore. I was ash: pure carbon. And to carbon, I return."

Today, in Totenburg, a new chapter unfolds as fresh adepts of the Brotherhood gather in a solemn ritual of ascension.\n\nWithin the hallowed chamber, where shadows dance and coal-black banners hang in reverence, the chosen few prepare to embark on a journey that transcends the realm of consciousness. Cloaked in the obsidian attire of the Brotherhood, these initiates stand as a bridge between the legacy of their leaders and the promises of the future.\n\nA sacred mixture of coal dust and metallic aromas smolders, its smoke winding like the tendrils of fate itself. A hooded figure, clad in the attire of a high-ranking mentor, steps forth to guide the aspirants. With each inhalation of the coal-infused fumes, a metamorphosis begins. The smoke courses through their veins as bizarre chants and dogmatic mantras meld into a symphony of transformation. As the initiates breathe in the essence of the Brotherhood's creed, their eyes glint with fire that could ignite the greatest forges of Bełchatów itself.\n\nBound by the smoke's ethereal tendrils, a sense of duty and unity emerges among the adepts. They are no longer individuals but part of a greater whole, a collective entity that reverberates with each strike of the pickaxe like a heartbeat. At this moment, the transition is complete—the initiates have become emissaries of the Brotherhood's ideology.\n\nAmid the coal mines and industrial might, the mystical mausoleum's significance endures.

What’s the problem?\n- HOW ABOUT HUMANITY AND MORALITY?!\nThere were no sensible arguments presented by any of the sides of this discussion. Public discourse died together with free speech, replaced by games for the masses. All of this was nothing but theater for the viewers.

He is - may the Elder forgive me for uttering this word - a Wiechowite.\n\nAt this point, any semblance of decorum had been shattered, and the officials abandoned their seats, turning the debate into a wild brawl.

He took a deep breath, inhaling the scent of saltwater and decay mixed with smoke and pollution.\n\nThe ground beneath his feet was a testament to the cataclysmic consequences of his choices. Scorched earth bore witness to the unrelenting pursuit of progress, a pursuit that had come at the cost of the very land that sustained them. Rivers, once teeming with life, now flowed sluggish and polluted, their waters reflecting a distorted image of a nation brought to its knees. So many lives were thrown away for his vision, burned alive, turned into a bleak ersatz of energy that would pump the rotten heart of Brotherhood’s industry.\n\nThe makeshift vessel that bobbed in the water was far from majestic. It was a grim result of the resourcefulness required to eke out an escape from the clutches of a crumbling nation. Ziemkiewicz's gaze lingered on it, his mind racing through the harsh choices that led him to this point. As the once-proud leader stepped onto the small boat, the creaking of the weathered wood seemed to echo the weight of his remorse. The sea, stretching out into infinity, served as both his escape and his isolation. The horizon, merely a thin line of demarcation between his past and the uncertain future, swallowed the remnants of a nation left in ruins.\n\nWith each passing wave, the fragments of a once-thriving country receded from view. The landscape, now devoid of hope, seemed to merge with the water as if the very essence of the land was being dissolved into the abyss. Poland was truly gone, and he had been its undertaker.\n\nAs the boat sailed away, carrying him from the devastation he had played a crucial part in, Ziemkiewicz's thoughts poignantly reflected the irreversible catastrophe he had brought upon his homeland. The weight of his actions and the stark realization of the emptiness left in their wake were etched into his very being. Millions of sacrificed souls had been inscribed into his conscience, screaming and tearing him apart. They reside only in his mind now, and no amount of distance will ease this pain."

Named after St. Barbara, the patron saint of miners, Barbórka is a revered occasion that highlights the deep-rooted importance of coal mining in the nation's identity.\n\nOn this day, coal miners are not just laborers but the nation's backbone, embodying resilience and determination. The celebrations encompass various events, from solemn religious ceremonies to vibrant parades through the towns and mining communities. A highlight of the celebrations is the blessing of miners' helmets and equipment in remembrance of St. Barbara's protection.\n\nBrotherhood's leadership, along with local officials and community leaders, gather in beer taverns to pay homage to miners for their extraordinary efforts. It's a moment to acknowledge the challenges faced in the mines, the camaraderie that binds them, and the invaluable contribution they make to the nation's progress.\n\nThis holiday emphasizes what is best in miners society; it's a community bound by history, tradition, and a shared commitment to shaping the nation's destiny. As the celebrations unfold, the Brotherhood stands united in honoring its workers and looking toward a future powered by their dedication."

It's a living, flying proof of the Brootherhood's might. - To solidify his beliefs even more, he took a quick glance at the radioactive ruins of Bałuty - Atomic power must never return to Poland.\nLancer Słomka's alarmed voice stopped the captain's train of thought - Sir, the rotors are slowing down, but the coal gauge doesn't even move.\n- Aspirant Stołeczny, report.\n- Sir - the aspirant began - I've been fueling the Vertibird according to the Scribes' instructions.\n- Clearly, it's not good enough. Throw in everything you can! - The captain ordered.\n- It didn't work, we're still losing height. - The lancer lamented - I'll...

Still, Lorenc didn't want to give up. He tried to exploit a moment of the stalkers' inattention and find something with which to cut the chain that bound him, but their enemies had been focused solely on them, rendering any escape attempts impossible. That was to be expected. If you live in Bałuty you can't afford the luxury of being distracted. The crumbling buildings, spreading radiation, bandits crazy enough to venture into this hell on Earth... One moment of hesitation and you're dead. All those facts made Lorenc wonder why these guys chose to still be here.\nAs they walked, the frustration was slowly building up. Eventually, the Aspirant, the youngest of the squad asked the stalkers in a moment of defiance - Where the hell are you taking us?\nThe leader of the convoy stopped and turned to the squad of Brotherhood soldiers.

But now, because he crashed a machine that he should've never been in, walked the area no Brotherhood member should've, and was about to meet a man who was supposed to be dead. Was this all some kind of trick?\nStołeczny and his squadmates finally reached their destination. The doors, hidden deep underground, opened and they entered a pastel-colored corridor. - Alright, we're here - the stalkers' leader announced and opened the wooden door labeled with the 'Great Ecologist's office' sign. Behind them sat no other, but Jakub Wiech himself. Older and scarred by the conditions he's been forced to live in, but it was him nonetheless. His lackeys pushed the Vertibird's crew with their stocks to force them to kneel.\n- What are we supposed to do with them, sir? - the Wiechowite stalker that escorted them asked - We've never captured one of them before.\n- Get them out of here and execute them. - We cannot reveal ourselves just yet - And we've got no jail to keep them.\nAt that moment, seizing upon the momentary distraction, Aspirant Stołeczny attempted to rush and attack Wiech to prove himself deserving of the knighting that would never come, but was instead quickly shot down by one of the guards. While the other members of his squad were too heart-broken by the uncovering of Ziemkiewicz's lies, Stołeczny, even in his last moments believed the Brotherhood would avenge them.\nHe couldn't have known that their crash wouldn't be recorded in the Brotherhood's archives, and that as far as everyone was concerned Operation: Maiden Flight never took place."

The situation was dire, and Elder Ziemkiewicz had convened an emergency meeting of the Brotherhood's highest-ranking officials to address the crisis.\n\nZiemkiewicz's voice was tinged with a mix of concern and anger as he addressed the council gathered before him. Reports from various regions painted a grim picture of chaos and upheaval caused by the Wiechowite uprising. The Atomic Crusade, driven by their belief in radical environmentalism and a desire to free the nation from the perceived shackles of coal, had managed to rally significant support in a short span of time.\n\nThe Brotherhood's intelligence agencies worked tirelessly to gather any information about the leaders and operatives of the Atomic Crusade.

No more nations, no more warlords and no more Brotherhood. Whoever was foolhardy enough to remain anywhere near the remains of the old Łódź Voivodeship wouldn’t survive outdoors for more than a day without a constant supply of air filters for their masks. Every waking moment beneath those carbon skies was hell incarnate. Those that were sent down to one of the many underground forced labor camps were considered lucky, as the dust pitifully kicked up by the black gold they had to mine for time immemorial, could not even begin to compare itself to what those at the surface had to endure.\n\nThere at the epicenter of it all defiantly stood Bełchatów. However now the shining jewel of the Brotherhood was nothing more than a monument to their misbegotten ways. A Tower of Babel engineered from soot, blood and industrial machinery ravenously consuming whatever fuel was left for it to devour. The clockwork town was still patrolled by Paladins still enthralled by their dream of an almighty Brotherhood. Their eyes, if they could even be seen through their dirty gas masks’ lenses, were mechanical and uncaring, scouting for any perceived dissent. But whatever they searched for, they would not find. There was no more resistance in Bełchatów, not for many years now. Every citizen that still remained and hadn’t yet seen their end to the smog was the perfect example of a Brotherhood citizen. A very little but perfected cog, running relentlessly in a defunct machine. \n\nBut as the coughs subsided, beneath the lifeless, monochromatic skies was left nothing. A cold, harsh nothingness where even mother nature was powerless to fix the mistakes of man as she had been ripped out by the roots a long time ago - chopped to bits and burned to fuel the folly of a group of silver-tongued madmen. \n\nOne wouldn’t be blamed for thinking that there’s no more hope left amidst the acid rains. They would be right. All that remains now is sheer stubbornness and a burning will to spit fate in the face. The Eagle will be reborn as a Phoenix in due time, no matter how long it will take, how much it will cost and how much more will need to be bled. \n\nFor that which has been, will return again..."

postsmog.2.desc: "The disappearance of Elder Ziemkiewicz had shaken the Brotherhood to its core, if there even was one left by now. The state that had been barely churning on for the past few years had finally begun to truly cave in under its own weight. The extent of corruption, lawlessness and outright anarchy that now unofficially reigned across all of Poland has now reached its melting point. Acting Elder Warzecha could only look on in pure rage as the very chapters making up the Brotherhood had begun an all out rebellion against his rule, either driven by a lust of power or to desperately spare themselves at least some of the devastation wrought down by the soot and ash.\n\nFirst to rebel happened to be the southern reaches of the Brotherhood. Rafał Woś, with his Silesian Chapter, has enjoyed a great deal of autonomy ever since the region’s conquest. His Chapter touted relatively less extreme and more leftist views from the rest of the Brotherhood’s inner circle, with many fanatics even accusing him of treason in the last days before Ziemkiewicz vanished. Despite the Brotherhood’s most devoted zealots’ ravings, Woś has not made any plans to radically change the Brotherhood’s course, only rolling back the most extreme actions undertaken by Warzecha.\n\nFollowing the example set by Woś, to the surprise of many within and without the inner circle, Marcin Rola and Tomasz Rzymkowski both left Bełchatów with their military units, setting up their own cliques within the Brotherhood. Marcin Rola’s Ashen Wanderers have been a highly praised detachment of Paladins ever since the Brotherhood’s inception, so their sudden act of treason has come as the greatest shock among the chaos of the past weeks. The future of Rola’s clique is uncertain, as not much news escapes the walls of their headquarters in Biała Podlaska.\n\nRzymkowski’s Chapter, touting itself as the Brotherhood of Steel, has gathered the infamous Black Paladins and other radical members of the Brotherhood in the city of Stalowa Wola. Decrying Warzecha’s leadership as illegitimate and unfit to carry on the legacy of Ziemkiewicz. Carrying on the tenets of the Brotherhood, Rzymkowski along with his Council of Paladins has thus far been the most outspoken about his wishes to once again reclaim Poland from the clutches of non-believers, traitors and bandits."

Barely any news emerged from Bełchatów following these events. The only orders that left the soot-stained metropolis called for the immediate capture and execution of every member of the Brotherhood suspected of scheming against the Elder. They were hastily written and oozing with fury despite his best efforts to conceal it beneath a cold and rigid tone.\n\nAmong those who found themselves on the list of known traitors were two new faces accompanied by a third, more prominent one, belonging to a member that had garnered considerable popularity for his crucial role in the Brotherhood’s ranks. That famous face would be Jakub Zgierski, a long-time spokesperson of the Brotherhood and one of the last people that Ziemkiewicz could truly consider a friend before he vanished from his bunker. Presently, he’s taken it upon himself to lead the Order of the Highest Time, an organization composed mainly of the former newspaper’s editorial staff, now devoted to analyzing and scrutinizing every issue of their new scripture.\n\nThose new faces, however - Bielecka and Śmiszek, have caused quite an unprecedented stir. Their respective fiefdoms could not be any different. Soon after the Masovian voivodeship was fully under the Brotherhood’s control, talks of a potential new branch rapidly spread out amongst the organization's members. This newly-founded Chapter, an experiment unfinished even now, was built from the remains of structures left behind in the region by Orlen. It was meant to be the source of all fuels, synthetics, and plastics needed by the Brotherhood to further its goals. The chapter continues its duty, still liquefying coal and molding plastics, though now not for the benefit of the Brotherhood as a whole, but solely for their own lucrative profits.\n\nŚmiszek’s clique, however, controlling most of Pomerelia, found itself not upholding the ideals of its parent organization, but instead reviving the long-forgotten legacy of Biedroń’s failed statelet. In open defiance and mockery of everything the late Elder stood for, Śmiszek has left behind nearly all of the Brotherhood's ideals, touting equality for all and a complete halt to the draconian laws put forward in the last desperate years of Ziemkiewicz’ and Warzecha’s reign. Hushed whispers emanating from their headquarters speak of even more absurd plans, such as cutting back on the Brotherhood’s overexploitation and optimization of the industrial sector."

And we were right to a degree as the traditional faiths and denominations of Kuyavia faded to obscurity. We weren't able to predict that in their place a new, foreign version of Christianity would take their place. All of that has happened in the region can be attributed to a single person: the Burned Man. Karol Wilkosz, as that was his real name, was one of many who were deemed guilty of spreading ecofascist propaganda. He and 10 other Varsovians were put on fire in what our paladins like to call the 'Kin to coal' ritual. all the other 10 executees died that day, but Wilkosz survived.\n\nAfter that, he became one of the most vicious enemies of the Brotherhood, except for the Wiechovites themselves. He traveled to Kuyavia where he began to spread the radical version of Mormonism, an exotic sect of Christianity that originated in the United States, building support among the local population. Now, that our organization was beginning to crumble he called his followers to arms and declared the formation of the Republic of New Kuyavia. His new state is a fundamentalist Mormon republic, so we can expect the typical abortion ban and mandatory church attendance. There are more unusual laws with their source in Mormonist doctrine such as prohibition against coffee and tattoos or fines for using foul language and those are still seen as somewhat controversial. It will take some time for the most bizarre aspect of Mormonism such as human ascension to divinity or the allowance of polygamy to take root among Poles, but we fear it will not be enough for the Kuyavians to oust their charismatic leader."

unification.2.desc: "Pomimo zaniku łączności w Polsce po upadku, zawsze był stabilny strumień informacji płynący z dawnego województwa łódzkiego z powodu nuklearnego incydentu w Bałutach i dochodzeniu otaczającym go. Dzisiaj, region ponownie został aktywny;\n\nW Łodzi, Rafał Ziemkiewicz- wysoce konserwatywny autor i dziennikarz w przeszłości - ogłosił totalną hegemonię tak zwanego „Bractwa Węgla” nad byłymi terenami województwa. Bractwo - wojskowy zakon anty-ekologicznych fanatyków- wziął na siebie zniszczenie zielonej polityki i przyniesienia „zdrowego rozsądku” i technologicznego oraz ekonomicznego postępu z powrotem do Polski. Reputacja kliki i ekonomiczna oraz wojskowa siła są źródłem alarmu dla jego sąsiadów, i wygląda na to, że my również będziemy musieli się temu bliżej przyglądać, byśmy nie musieli pochylić się nad władzą węgla i stali."

unificationreg.2.desc: "It was only natural for Brotherhood and its unstable economy to pursue more and more resources as their needs grow and their economic doctrine remains obsolete. While the conquest of the Jura region provides them, with enough coal to terrorize Poland for now, many experts state, their industry is unsustainable in the long run if they don't reform. As the public consciousness about global warming increased many, particularly in the West, are anxious that the faction that seemingly wants the world to burn has not yet been put down and even has grown in power putting down the pro-atomic rebellion. As of now, other factions may still defeat the Brotherhood by forcing Ziemkiewicz's faction into a stalemate. It is possible that the Carbon Counter-revolution may yet be stopped. Only time will tell."

unificationsupreg.2.desc: "The Brotherhood's flame still burns.\nDespite the difficulties the Brotherhood remained adamant about their beliefs and as of yet refused to change their ways to accommodate to 'eco-fascist agenda' as they call it. As a matter of fact, they are even more radicalized, than they were in 2036. Grotesque industrialization and unthinkable disregard for the environment secured them the position of relative dominance. Only a few factions on the territory of former Poland can stop them. If things proceed as they do, the United Nations will issue a humanitarian mission with military support, despite other dangers that plague the Earth right now. But the legislative process is slow and it looks like the Poles will have to solve the carbon problem by themselves. At least for the time being."

super.2.t: "[GetNewspaper]The Brotherhood of Coal unifies Poland."
super.2.desc: "After much struggle, the Brotherhood of Coal has finally conquered Poland leaving smoking battlefields and smoking chimneys behind themselves. The heavy industry and ideological favor provided by the clique of experienced journalists leading the organization proved to be effective assets in Brotherhood's conquest. Whether the Brotherhood can survive the long-awaited peacetime is of more concern as their order needs a constant influx of coal reserves to sustain itself. With no more Polish lands to appropriate, and their neighbors too powerful to subdue, the Brotherhood, experts say, will soon collapse due to power shortage and severe degradation of the environment. What's worse, numerous reports are penetrating the thick, smoggy veil of misinformation that the reformist faction in the Brotherhood was effectively sidelined, dooming the state in the near future."

The best evidence of it is the recent abdication of the elder Elder Zimkiewicz and replacing him with a younger and more vigorous Roksana Węgiel. The former pop star became the face of the reformist faction and while not distancing herself from the Brotherhood's heritage, she promised to quiet the most radical voices in the organization and pay more attention to the environment. While manny welcome the change, some accuse her of being merely a mask steered by the old guard whose purpose is to deceive the West with empty promises to gain international recognition. The less sceptical still doubt wheter she can undo the damage already done by the previous administration."

POLITICS_RAFAL_ZIEMKIEWICZ_DESC: "2027, Bełchatów.\n\nWłókniarzy. Lipowa. 1 Maja.\nCodziennie, stary, wściekły i bardzo głupi człowiek, przemierza ulice, kaszląc i sapiąc po drodze. Przypadkowy przechodzień mógłby sobie pomyśleć, że jest on biednym, starym prykiem, którego płuca wypełnione są smogiem wypluwanym przez pobliską elektrownię. Mieszkańcy ulic jednak dobrze wiedzą, że to właśnie smog napędza tego starego człowieka.\n\nNiewielu bardziej zasłużyło się Bractwu niż jego starszy i pierwszy skryba. Gdy kraj pogrążył się w chaosie, Ziemkiewicz zjednoczył ludzi wokół ideałów przywrócenia normalności i przetrwania, wykorzystując energię z węgla i silny porządek hierarchiczny. To znany pisarz, jego książki stały się podstawą ideologiczną Bractwa i wizją lepszej przyszłości - opartej na brutalnych interesach i walce z dyktatem zielonego faszyzmu narzuconą przez UE. Choć jego przywództwo jest w dużej mierze symboliczne, jest jednak najbardziej szanowaną osobą w bractwie.\n\nDumnie obserwując czarne chmury zza zakurzonych tafli szkła, z jednego z wielu placów przemysłowych zbudowanych przez Bractwo, Ziemkiewicz jest piekielnie zdeterminowany, by szerzyć stary, dobry, zdrowy rozsądek w całym państwie. Ma do tego swoje fabryki (aby produkować broń), swoją zmotoryzowaną armię (aby nieść postęp zacofanym lewakom), swoje książki (aby napędzać serca i umysły ludzi) i swoje palce (aby ze złością tweetować). To powiedziawszy...\n\nW głowie Ziemkiewicza powoli zaczęły pojawiać się wątpliwości. „Czy to na pewno właściwy sposób postępowania?” „Czy to, co robimy *kaszle* jest naprawdę słuszne?” „Coraz więcej i więcej raportów *kaszle* o problemach z oddychaniem i zatrutych ziemiach dociera do naszych biur, i-” Nie. Wystarczy. Bez PRAWDZIWEGO, napędzanego ropą i węglem przemysłu, Polska byłaby niczym. Nie byłoby produkcji, prądu, samochodów, pracy - żylibyśmy jak na średniowiecznym zadupiu. Jesteśmy Bractwem. Kierujemy się zdrowym rozsądkiem. Nasze słowa są poparte śmiercionośną bronią i gigantyczną produkcją. To my mamy racje i zwyciężymy.\n\n*kaszle*"
POLITICS_LUKASZ_WARZECHA_DESC: "§LSteam Trams - one of the many marvels of the Brotherhood’s engineering are but one of the Paladin of Transportation’s grand ideas. The roaring coal-powered machines glide back and forth across the Bełchatów area providing efficient and cheap transport to its denizens. While Warzecha himself is a great proponent of motorization and the usage of fossil fuels, his plans have thus far largely been hindered by the massive fuel deficit that followed the Fall. Together with his followers, he was one of the first to heed Ziemkiewicz’s call to action, and his supply of trucks and SUVs proved essential to securing the Bełchatów region.§!"
POLITICS_STANISLAW_JANECKI_DESC: "§LThe gray eminence of the Brotherhood, the Proctor responsible for gathering intelligence and handling state secrets hardly ever talks about his past. When so, he provides contradictory information, shrouding his former life in an aura of mystery. The single scraps of data regarding his previous exploits, whether in old newspaper clippings or archived internet articles, are being diligently removed by his web of underlings before they reach the public eye. Nobody is better than Janecki in closing the lips of inquisitive wannabe detectives, and the other Paladins know that fact crystal-clear, utilizing his skills to find and silence any signs of dissent within the Brotherhood. But sometimes even they wonder whether they know who Janecki truly is...§!"
POLITICS_TOMASZ_RZYMKOWSKI_DESC: "§LOne of the youngest members of the Brotherhood’s Elite, and nevertheless one of its most powerful, serving as the clique's Head Paladin. Following the Fall Rzymkowski made use of his old contacts in the National Movement, helping his late predecessor Tomasz Sommer with the organization of the Brotherhood’s military forces. He created a system of indoctrinating new recruits, hailing them as defenders of common sense, fighting back against the Green Scourge. Later, he worked as the Black Curator, re-carbonizing the core curriculum in schools to stop the environmentalist corruption of the youth. His closest subordinates are known as the most fanatical members of the Brotherhood, tightly wrapped up in his ideological influence.§!"
POLITICS_WITOLD_GADOMSKI_DESC: "§LThe most ideologically questionable of the Brotherhood’s Paladins, responsible for handling the economy. Gadomski's past activity in „Gazeta Wyborcza”, a liberal newspaper promoting disastrous ecologist and green-aligned ideas, made him a very unlikely candidate to ever join the Brotherhood's ranks, let alone rise to the position of one of its highest Elites. Yet, he has since proven his dedication to the cause tenfold, making use of his understanding of economic organization to assemble an entire financial system practically from scratch. Despite his deeply neoliberal beliefs, Gadomski accepts the usage of interventionist methods as necessary to ensure the final victory of the Brotherhood and its values.§!"
POLITICS_TOMASZ_SOMMER_DESC: "§LIf an outsider were to ask a Bełchatów citizen to name someone they consider a hero, an ideal man, and a dedicated soldier, he will no doubt hear the name of the Head Paladin in response. It was he who stood against every threat to the Brotherhood's survival, leading his fellow troops to one victory after another. His fierce attacks on the Scouts, Hooligans, and the Dialogue followers often ended with bloody but successful results, bringing glory to our regime. Revered among the highest echelons, Sommer's grandeur and influence rival even those of the High Elder himself. Now, whenever the Paladin’s Black Opel Insignia drives along Bełchatów’s streets, many cheer and take off their caps in respect. Others, however, remain silent...§!"
POLITICS_JAKUB_WIECH_DESC: "In many ways, Jakub Wiech is the antithesis of Ziemkiewicz's teachings, the perfect boogeyman to pin all the blame for the Brotherhood's failures on. Though mountains of propaganda have long distorted nearly all of the journalist's ideals, labeling his band of misfits as pawns in some unknown global conspiracy to take down the 'last bastion of progress,' the true danger Wiech poses for Bełchatów's elite lies not in the differences, but the similarities between him and Ziemkiewicz. As a lifelong proponent of moderate conservatism, the journalist could have felt right at home in the state his nemesis created. Perhaps in another world, they could have been allies, but in a nation built on the dogma of coal's superiority, any suggestion to the contrary is nothing less than treasonous heresy.\n\nThough he was always unwelcome on the Brotherhood's territory, nothing could stop Wiech from exposing the truth about the dangers the faction posed not just to Poland but the entire world. Despite his life being at risk every time he spoke, the journalist railed on about the need for a transition from the rapidly depleting fossil fuels to the near-infinite, sustainable power of atom. Wherever he appeared, a following sprung up, clinging to his ideals for hope amidst Ziemkiewicz's growing fanaticism. Each speech, every citizen brought to the nuclear cause weakened the Brotherhood's regime, even if just a little, sparking hope for much-needed reform. Soon, however, the days of peacefully changing the minds of Łódzkie's citizens would be over as the region's overlords sought to crack down on what they viewed as a plague spreading through their lands.\n\nJakub Wiech never wished to be a leader, but without him, the nuclear movement would perish, violently snuffed out by Ziemkiewicz and his lackeys. Despite knowing what fate awaits him if he fails, the journalist ignited an open rebellion against the Brotherhood's forces, launching the Atomic Crusade to restore sanity to the voivodeship. Some might say the odds he faces are insurmountable, that he has only doomed his followers to serve as cannon fodder for the experienced paladins, but that has never deterred Wiech before. All his life, he has battled for the nuclear cause, and he will not relent now. Even if he has to die for it, his sacrifice will forever be immortalized"
POLITICS_ROKSANA_WEGIEL_DESC: "Roksana Węgiel needn't have taken part in politics. Even after the Fall, she still enjoyed a successful singing career, blissfully free from the wars and devastation tearing the nation apart. A tour around Silesia, a concert in Kuyavia; the warlords paid well for any kind of entertainment that would take their citizens' attentions away from the struggles of their daily lives, if only for a brief moment. But as she traversed the nation without aim, witnessing the chaos she was continuously sheltered from, a yearning developed within Roksana to amount to more than just a traveling bard, singing joyous tunes as the world around her burned. And in Bełchatów, she would finally find her purpose.\n\nFrom her earliest appearance in the city, a loyal following developed around Roksana. Unlike other destinations, however, the people of Bełchatów didn't revere her merely for her performances but also for the ideals she grew to represent. Perhaps through a fortuitous coincidence, but the singer quickly became the face of the Brotherhood's reformist wing - a rallying point for all those disillusioned with Ziemkiewicz's descent into madness. Capitalizing on her rapidly rising notoriety, she quickly joined the ranks of the Carbonari, eventually climbing up to the position of the Brotherhood's speaker as a concession to calm the increasingly restless masses. For her part, all she had to do was stay silent and remain loyal.\n\nRoksana Węgiel could have stopped there and enjoyed the comfort of her prominent stature, but the damage inflicted upon Poland by Ziemkiewicz's clique proved too great to ignore. Left with no other choice, she seized upon a moment of weakness and rallied the disaffected youth, usurping the title of Eldress and the massive burden it entails. Now in charge, she distances herself from her predecessor's radical stance and pursues a more moderate, flexible approach to the Brotherhood's issues. In the eyes of her followers, Roksana's ascent is a result of ultimate selflessness, a personal sacrifice to save the dying country. The truth may not be so flattering, and the singer's intentions not as noble as they paint them, but her rule does bring a much-needed thaw nonetheless. For that, she will always be revered, even if every move was just a calculated ploy for personal advancement."
