unification.110.desc:0 "The Fall did little to stifle the growing influence of PKN Orlen. Morawiecki’s decision to empower the company would prove to be one of his gravest errors, as one day he’d find himself directly opposed by the corporate giant. History books will forever remember that the end of his reign and the definitive fall of the Third Polish Republic came at the hands of Daniel Obajtek. The petrobaron’s state is one built on total corporate oversight, with Orlen spreading into virtually every branch of daily life, from groceries to housing, creating an ingenious system where the fruits of the population’s labor are reinvested back into the company. Now menacingly overlooking the capital, Orlen’s chairman eyes out new avenues for growth, and no part of Poland is safe from his grasp."
