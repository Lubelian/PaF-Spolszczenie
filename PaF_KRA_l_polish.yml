unification.143.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The Republic of Kraków unifies Lesser Poland!"
unification.143.desc:0 "Hope returns to Małopolskie, as one of the nation’s most fractured regions has now been unified. Furthermore, unlike certain other parts of Poland, a sense of normalcy now persists in Kraków as a relatively moderate force – one loyal to the ideals of liberalism takes the reins of power. Łukasz Gibała has long sought to take the highest office in the city, slowly growing his base of support with each electoral failure, and thus, when Majchrowski finally failed in controlling unrest and a civil war erupted within the former capital, Gibała quickly became one of the favorites to win. His victory means a visible leftward shift in the notoriously conservative region as sweeping reforms aiming to heal the war-torn area have already been rolled out. And it seems more change is already on the way."
