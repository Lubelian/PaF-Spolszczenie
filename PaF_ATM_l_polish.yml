POLITICS_WIECH_DESC: "In many ways, Jakub Wiech is the antithesis of Ziemkiewicz's teachings, the perfect boogeyman to pin all the blame for the Brotherhood's failures on. Though mountains of propaganda have long distorted nearly all of the journalist's ideals, labeling his band of misfits as pawns in some unknown global conspiracy to take down the 'last bastion of progress,' the true danger Wiech poses for Bełchatów's elite lies not in the differences, but the similarities between him and Ziemkiewicz. As a lifelong proponent of moderate conservatism, the journalist could have felt right at home in the state his nemesis created. Perhaps in another world, they could have been allies, but in a nation built on the dogma of coal's superiority, any suggestion to the contrary is nothing less than treasonous heresy. \n\nThough he was always unwelcome on the Brotherhood's territory, nothing could stop Wiech from exposing the truth about the dangers the faction posed not just to Poland but the entire world. Despite his life being at risk every time he spoke, the journalist railed on about the need for a transition from the rapidly depleting fossil fuels to the near-infinite, sustainable power of atom. Wherever he appeared, a following sprung up, clinging to his ideals for hope amidst Ziemkiewicz's growing fanaticism. Each speech, every citizen brought to the nuclear cause weakened the Brotherhood's regime, even if just a little, sparking hope for much-needed reform. Soon, however, the days of peacefully changing the minds of Łódzkie's citizens would be over as the region's overlords sought to crack down on what they viewed as a plague spreading through their lands. \n\nJakub Wiech never wished to be a leader, but without him, the nuclear movement would perish, violently snuffed out by Ziemkiewicz and his lackeys. Despite knowing what fate awaits him if he fails, the journalist ignited an open rebellion against the Brotherhood's forces, launching the Atomic Crusade to restore sanity to the voivodeship. Some might say the odds he faces are insurmountable, that he has only doomed his followers to serve as cannon fodder for the experienced paladins, but that has never deterred Wiech before. All his life, he has battled for the nuclear cause, and he will not relent now. Even if he has to die for it, his sacrifice will forever be immortalized."

ATM_fission_desc: "After years of meticulous organization, we are ready to give the Brotherhood what they asked for. An Atomic Crusade. We believe it is not too late to save Poland from those carbon cooks. But first our cause needs to gain popular support by exposing, the Brotherhood's lies. And there's no better way to expose those lies, than to issue a proclamation by a 'long-dead' Jakub Wiech."
ATM_supplies_from_lodz_desc: "Although we only recently decided to launch an armed resistance against the Brotherhood, we've been preparing for the uprising for a long time. We've established many hidden supply cashes in the urban jungle of Łódź and even the current occupation of the city by the Brotherhood didn't compromise the safety of our contraband. We can finally put our concealed weapons to good use now that we decided to fight for our cause."
ATM_apocalyptic_roads_desc: "As the Brotherhoods conquests grew, so did their complecency. The armed escort protecting their convoys became lighter and lighter as the illusion of safety became ingrained in the Paladins' minds. Now that we've risen against them, we can exploit their lowered guard and claim their supplies for our own."
ATM_strike_at_nucleus_desc: "We knew this day would come. The Bełchatów Power Plant - all that was a thorn in the side of every ecologist even before the Fall. Efficiency be damned, the Paladins made a symbol to rally behind. Now it is time to crush this symbol. What's important is that we show the populus that even the places most sacred to the Brotherhood are not invulnerable. That would be enough as we can't destroy the whole facility with sabotagists only. Not that we would want to as Wiech seems to have his own plans regarding the future of the power plant."

ATM_decarbonization_desc: "It's... over. The Brotherhood has fallen. We've long dreaded the moment the guns finally go silent, as by all means, we should have been the vanquished. And yet, we stand victorious, with a country to run and our former enemies to judge. Only now that the drums of war have stopped beating and the euphoria of triumph subdued has the sheer scale of the damage become evident. We rule over ruins and wastelands, smog-covered cities, and fields unfit for cultivation. Carbon has destroyed Łódzkie, scarring the land far worse than the bomb could have ever done. Now, the real work begins to undo the devastation so willingly embraced by our predecessors. Though in its dying throes, it has entrenched itself into the ecosystem and the people's minds, the darkness of carbon shall give way to the light of atom."
ATM_brother_ziemkiewicz_desc: "Oh, how wonderfully have the tables turned. Our greatest enemy, the face of the Brotherhood, the man who tried to root us all out, now finds himself at our mercy.  The recent string of defeats has exposed Ziemkiewicz for who he really is - a raving lunatic lost in his own delusions of grandeur. Aside from serving as his clique's figurehead, he held little true power, overshadowed by his more methodical puppet masters. As tempting as it may be to fully exact our revenge, there is one thing we have to acknowledge - Ziemkiewicz is no threat. Still, the lives lost due to his mad ramblings must be avenged, and our supporters chant in unison for a particular verdict - death. A little bit of leniency could go a long way toward rehabilitating our more moderate opponents, but can we really let such a monster live after all the suffering he's caused us?"
ATM_brother_warzecha_desc: "Of all our fallen foes, none deserves immediate retribution more than 'Paladin' Warzecha - the true architect of the Brotherhood's system of cruelty and exploitation. For years, the little rat cowered behind his more popular colleagues, pulling the strings of Poland's destruction from behind the scenes. Every decision that set Bełchatów's clique further down its dark path has a paper trail leading back to one man - the embodiment of all of the Brotherhood's worst qualities. Warzecha is irredeemable. Given another chance, he'd gladly do it all over again, damning millions to live in a polluted wasteland without ever losing that smug little grin of his. The verdict has already been decided. The bastard has to die for his crimes, and we'll gladly watch the sentence carried out, filled with a particular sense of satisfaction."
ATM_deindoctrination_desc: "Besides the environmental disaster rapidly unfolding before us, another, more humanitarian tragedy has entrenched itself. The constant stream of unchallenged propaganda spewed out by the Brotherhood's news outlets has whittled down the minds of the populace, turning them into willing participants in their own nation's suicide. They cling to the teachings of their clueless masters, embracing policies that will destroy all they've ever known as dogma. Though even if they oppose us, they're not our enemies, but victims, broken and in need of guidance. Convincing them of the righteousness of our ways will be a long and arduous process, but through baby steps, we'll help them break free from the lies once more."
ATM_saving_polish_microclimates_desc: "Flowers wither in the chemically polluted ground. Contaminated rivers flow through forests of stumps. Wild beasts starve as their food chain lies broken. Poland stands amid a total, self-inflicted, environmental collapse - one that will take the combined effort of multiple generations to offset. We inherited a region destroyed by unchecked industrial expansion to a point where the constant need for more resources threatened not just the balance of the ecosystem, but the survival of the population altogether. As much as we need it, there is sadly no miraculous solution, only a slow, difficult recovery. To that end, we must form a governmental climate agency to assess what has been lost, what can still be saved, and where we can pour our funds to really make a change. Little by little, nature will return, even if just a shadow of its former self."
ATM_acknowledge_global_warming_desc: "Long gone are the days when fearsome winters gripped Poland, and a blanket of snow covered the land for months on end. But the images of snowball fights and downhill sled races are not just a case of nostalgia towards the blissful days of youth, and neither is their disappearance a coincidence, but an example of something greater, something far more sinister - climate change. For too long has the government blankly rejected all evidence of humanity's disastrous effects on the environment, all while actively contributing to the process's acceleration. No more. We are all complicit in mankind's greatest crime against nature, and it's high time we take responsibility for the damage we've caused. In a war against the Earth, there can be no victors, so if there is to be any future for our life on this planet, we will all do our part to finally make things right."
ATM_destroy_malicious_media_desc: "In the Brotherhood, only one truth existed, diligently spewed out by a myriad of government-funded publications. Though they attempted to discern themselves and pretended to be more than just thoughtless propaganda tubes, they shared one thing in common - the lack of any journalistic integrity in their advocacy for Ziemkiewicz's harmful policies. While it will take a long time to combat the misinformation already implanted into the citizens' heads, we can at least stop its further spread.  The major media conglomerates, such as the madman's beloved 'Do Rzeczy' will be broken up and replaced with a number of independent papers promoting our narrative. The lesser outlets will continue operating,   albeit under heavy scrutiny and anti-coal bend to deradicalize their readers. The war for the people's minds has only begun, and these publications will serve as our frontline soldiers."
ATM_industrial_cults_desc: "Not even an institution as sacred as the Church found itself spared of the meddling of Ziemkiewicz's cronies, bastardized into a twisted form of itself that spread not the word of God, but the clique's industrialist agenda. After years of such dogma spewing from the altars, many of the more devout have started worshiping coal as their Golden Calf. They pray to it, surround themselves with it, tout its glory in hidden meetings. We must restore the church back to its former glory and rid it of these corrupt influences by rehabilitating the disgraced pastors who refused to cooperate in the corruption of their flock. Eventually, we will bring the lost lambs back to their holy shepherd. So help us God."
ATM_brother_rzymkowski_desc: "Just like lambs spared from the slaughter, so too are we gathered to pass judgment on our former killer. All the massacres, all the war crimes, everything can be traced back to one man - the butcher of Bełchatów, Paladin Rzymkowski. While many of our foes, shorn of their commander's protection, claim to have been merely following orders, this genocidal maniac's tactics had nothing to do with war. Had he gotten his way, each and every last one of us would've ended up six feet under, with a bullet to the back of the head to end their struggle and a mass grave to bury their legacy. There is no punishment fit for this bastard except that which he so willingly dispensed. There will be no second chances, only the satisfaction of our brethren's lives avenged. Rzymkowski does not deserve more."
ATM_brotherhood_arms_industry_desc: "Now that the Brotherhood's war machine has been stopped, only the factories that fueled it remain, some dormant, some still working to supply the fallen behemoth. The military industry left behind by our fallen foes is impressive, but it is misguided at best. Just like the whole state it armed - wasteful beyond belief. All it did was suck further resources out of the already depleted region, bringing the environmental doomsday clock closer to midnight with each shell produced. The only way to stop this system of exploitation is to curtail it across the board. We have more than enough factories as it is. We will cut production down to what we truly need, and get rid of all unnecessary assembly lines and projects, at least until we figure out a way to somehow make them sustainable."
ATM_dissolve_paladin_hierarchy_desc: "In the Brotherhood, earning the title of Paladin was perhaps the highest achievement in an officer's career. And yet, none knew precisely what that rank meant. Some served as field commanders, some as administrators, others even as simple guards. Though they may hold the same moniker, no two Paladins are of the same status. Maintaining such an uneven and unorganized structure of military leadership can only lead to further chaos, especially as we integrate our own units into it. Therefore, we must restore a tried-and-tested structure within the army, drawing from the traditional ranks of the once-mighty Polish armed forces as our basis. Unlike our enemies, we'll maintain a clear hierarchy with a well-defined chain of command and a fluid stream of promotion that will guarantee us a steady supply of both junior and senior officers, not just a bunch of lifelong appointees to the one exalted, all-encompassing position."
ATM_amnesty_for_officers_desc: "Not all of the generals we faced in our recent conflict are ideological fanatics. Some are simply spineless sellswords, willing to offer their services to anyone as long as it furthers their careers and brings a healthy stream of funds back into their pockets. While normally we'd steer clear of such snakes, regrettably, our army does suffer from a lack of higher leadership. We don't have nearly enough time to train our own loyal cadres, leaving us with only one option - take in the officers willing to fight for our cause, or rather coin. We'll heavily peer through their resumes, and make them swear oaths to fight for the glory of Atom, but ultimately, their loyalty is like a pennant in the wind - it turns in whatever direction fate currently blows. If we ever fall on hard times, they'll abandon us without a second thought."
ATM_nucleation_desc: "Now that we've got the foundation set, it's time to start adopting our new structure. Setting up a functional military administration from scratch is no easy task, especially when you also have to clean up someone else's mess at the same time. With our meager resources and in record time, we need to set up a central command, establish garrison posts across the entire region, and build training centers to prepare for the influx of new recruits. The task ahead seems herculean, but at least we don't have to face it alone. Some of the former Brotherhood officers under our employ have at least a basic understanding of how such a system should function. This is their chance to prove their worth."
ATM_long_road_to_normality_desc: "Let there be no doubt. We are deeply indebted to our partisans. They've proven their worth in battle beyond all expectations, but regrettably, untrained guerilla formations are not a scalable model fit for established states like ours. The absence of regulation is one thing, but the main issue is the lack of any standardized training regimen. In our last war, we often had to resort to sending anyone who knew how to shoot straight into combat. It's only through sheer luck and enemy incompetence that our forces pulled through. Things won't be so easy from now on. We're up against established regimes, often backed by remnants of the once-fiersome Army. If we're to stand against them, we'll need our troops thoroughly drilled to the highest standards. No more slacking off. There's war on the horizon, and this time we'll be prepared."
ATM_stop_ridiculous_army_programs_desc: "Wonder weapons - eye candy of dictators, vain representations of their fetishization of power. Given the Brotherhood's megalomanic aspirations, it's no wonder they wasted a large chunk of their budget on impractical, unachievable projects that would supposedly lay waste to their enemies. Multiple industrial complexes operated for that reason alone, wasting copious amounts of manpower and resources constructing unusable junk that now litters their warehouses. From now on, all such vanity projects will be halted, and all failed prototypes scrapped for parts. We don't expect to find much useful, but in our situation, every loose cog matters. Once the trash has been cleared out, we'll repurpose the assembly lines to produce materials that could actually boost both our war effort and the population's well-being, no longer chasing impossible dreams of unmatched power. It's time for some responsibility around here."
ATM_brother_gadomski_desc: "Paladin Gadomski is a snake, an opportunist, willing to betray all he holds dear to save his position. He held no love for the Brotherhood's dogma, and he jumped ship as soon as any real danger arose. Normally, we'd steer clear of such untrustworthy individuals, but the sad truth is - we have no other choice. Out of the handful of paladins willing to cooperate with us to any degree, none knows the inner workings of the Brotherhood quite like Gadomski. Whether we like it or not, we need his expertise to refit its industrial machine and get everything up and running again. Luckily, the spineless coward has already ingratiated himself with much of our higher leadership by aiding us in the struggle against his former colleagues. Therefore, the plan is simple - a slap on the wrist to appease the masses and a cushy position once the sentence concludes."
ATM_redemption_for_civilian_sector_desc: "Having inherited the region from our former foes, we are inevitably forced to make do with whatever industry they deemed fit to leave us. Normally, we'd appreciate being able to build upon an already-functional system, but the Brotherhood's civilian sector is simply irredeemable. The few little embers of independent economic activity that remain exist only to fuel the suicidal system of resource exploitation and keep the population servile and dependent on the meager services provided. To break the disastrous cycle we need a complete refit, and for that - the expertise of someone who helped bring about this system in the first place. Gadomski does not deserve our attention, but he might just be our only chance to fix this mess. If he can find a way to turn the situation around, we might be lenient enough to grant him redemption."
ATM_repopulate_the_countryside_desc: "All over the region, empty houses dot the landscape, slowly decaying without their rightful owners. Under Ziemkiewicz's regime, thousands have been forcefully estranged from their countryside homes to feed the Brotherhood's industrial regime, and now that sanity has prevailed, it's time for them to finally return. Whether by their own means or with our help, the people will be reunited with their former possessions, allowing them to once more embrace their traditional ways of life. Though the fields they once toiled have most likely been dug up and left desecrated in search of any natural resources beneath, we'll give them whatever subsidies they need to get back on their feet. It's the least we can do for them after all the pain they've endured."
ATM_fight_the_smog_desc: "Though the Brotherhood's mad pursuit of industrial expansion at all costs has been violently halted, a relic of their ways persists in the very air we breathe. One can hardly exit their apartment without choking on the leftover smog, haunting us like a specter of our past sins against the environment. If we fail to quickly root it out, the damage might become permanent, forever turning central Poland into an uninhabitable wasteland. No matter how many resources it will take, we must remove this lingering poison so that one day, the sun's rays may once again shine over Bełchatów, free from deadly clouds that confine the city to darkness."
ATM_revitalize_agrarian_industry_desc: "After years of misuse, chemical pollution, and near-constant warfare, the once-fertile fields of our region have largely turned bare.  The few plots that weathered the harsh conditions have since been destroyed to make way for further industrial expansion. Thanks to the Brotherhood's lack of foresight, or rather its complete indifference toward the plight of its starving population, we're left with solitary, scattered patches of arable farmland on the outskirts of the voivodeship, where the machinery had yet to reach. As dire as the situation may seem, however, not all is lost. The most resilient strains have adapted to the unwelcoming climate. If we manage to plant their seeds across our territory, some may yet bear fruit. We'll use whatever spare funds we have to subsidize the ailing farmers and help them cultivate what remains of their lands. Hopefully, in time, they'll be able to support themselves once more."
ATM_green_is_back_on_menu_desc: "Though we've managed to restore a somewhat steady supply of fruits and vegetables to our markets, it seems we're faced with yet another problem - the lack of any actual demand. After years of anti-vegetarian propaganda, the people of Łódzkie have come to treat any natural products as outright harmful, ascribing all sorts of made-up health risks and conditions to even the simplest of plants. As ridiculous as it may sound, we need to go back to the drawing board and dispel these harmful myths, incentivizing the consumption of vegetables at all costs, even at a significant loss to our coffers. Our people are like toddlers, throwing a fit against the flavors they've come to forget. Just like their parents taught them to love plant-based food once, so too will we educate them to enjoy it again."
ATM_brother_janecki_desc: "Few names evoke as much fear within our ranks as that of Paladin Janecki. The grey eminence of the Brotherhood has long wreaked havoc among our sympathizers, meticulously picking us off one by one like a hunter silently stalking his prey. While we may have broken the shackles of his influence, the distrust sown by his infiltrators permeates our structure until this very day. Now that all his dark machinations have fallen through and he stands trial for his numerous crimes, the shadow no longer looms so large, reduced to a pitiful, powerless visage. Still, voices of those who lost family, friends, and comrades to Janecki's vicious persecutions clamor for their oppressor's death, demanding vengeance regardless of the rule of law. But can they be blamed? What mercy can there possibly be for such a monster?"
ATM_proctor_secret_files_desc: "A figure such as Janecki does not stay in power through the goodwill of his superiors alone. There was little reason for anyone in the Brotherhood's highest circles to trust him, yet fewer to not replace him with someone more loyal and predictable. There can be only one explanation. They feared opposing him, and for that to be the case, the damn spider needed to have dirt on everyone worth their salt. He must have written it all down somewhere. If we can get our hands on this information, we could easily keep his former colleagues in check. Besides, he might have even gone far enough to have something damning on our own leadership. It's better to be safe than sorry. We'll search through all his leftover possessions, leaving no stone unturned. If he has the files stashed away somewhere, we will eventually find them. Better us than our enemies."
ATM_secret_service_apparatus_desc: "While the Brotherhood's legacy is largely that of failure, there is one thing we have to give to them - they knew how to keep dissidents, both domestic and foreign, in check. Janecki was no fool. The organization he established is a spy's wet dream, able to wriggle its tendrils into the tiniest of cracks in search of any unrest. In the ever-shifting political landscape of post-Fall Poland, where loyalties often change on a whim, we'd be wise to repurpose the agency to suit our needs. Of course, we don't strive for nearly the same level of brutality and terror as the former director, but it still wouldn't hurt appropriating some of his more effective methods of control. Some may call us hypocritical, some may turn their backs on us, but while resuming the invasive campaign of state-sponsored invigilation won't get us any allies, it will ensure something far more important - survival."
ATM_cleanse_the_ranks_desc: "Though our efforts to repurpose the Brotherhood’s secret services have thus far yielded acceptable results, it seems the ideological rot Janecki instilled into every level of his beloved organization goes deeper than we could have possibly predicted. From the lowest clerks to the highest officers, this infection has reached all, turning them into sleeper agents against our cause. While they may diligently perform their tasks for now, who knows what sort of dirt they’re digging up on our leaders behind their backs, like a hornets' nest of traitors just waiting to be stirred? There can be no half-measures. This growing tumor will be excised before they have a chance to strike, even if it means replacing the entire agency with untrained loyalists."
ATM_stop_the_persecutions_desc: "After many years under the Brotherhood's jackboot, the people of Łódzkie have learned one emotion - fear. Janecki's network of spies dug deep, violently exposing the slightest traces of dissent or even doubt in the enforced doctrine. A cruel fate awaited those who dared speak up, as sometimes just a couple of poorly framed words over family dinners became grounds for a person's swift termination. And while a certain degree of order must be maintained, we cannot let such a brutal policy continue, not after it resulted in the deaths of so many of our ecologist comrades. We will do the right thing and loosen the reins so the persecuted dissidents will at last be able to come out of hiding. The dark clouds of tyranny are about to be dispelled."
ATM_bring_the_dissidents_desc: "Despite the Brotherhood portraying itself as an ideological monolith, it seems not all of its former members are beyond reproach. Aside from a large contingent of ideologues unceremoniously shunned for their opposition to the organization's radical turn, it seems even within the established ranks, a full-blown reformist wing took hold, spearheaded by the youthful passion and pragmatism of Roksana Węgiel. They may not agree with us completely, but their knowledge of this government's inner workings might prove indispensable in our quest to undo its most harmful policies. It's a shot in the dark, but it's better than doing nothing. Regardless of our opinions, we should at least make some diplomatic overtures to see if a partnership is at all possible. We'd rather have them on our side than face Europe's largest environmental crisis on our own."
ATM_greenpeace_poland_desc: "Few organizations have a reputation as controversial as Greenpeace. In many ways, their ideals contradict ours, and their opposition to nuclear energy has long been a thorn in the side of any legitimate environmental movement. Even now, we don't expect them to hold much love for our ideas on how to handle the crises at hand. Some may call it foolish to empower an organization so vehemently opposed to our state's core vision, but in our fight to stave off doomsday, we need all hands on deck. Surely, the activists will appreciate being able to finally come out of hiding, free from persecution, and given a near-blank cheque to resume their climate advocacy. They can grumble about our nuclear dreams internally all they want as long as they stay in their lane and don't interfere. It shouldn't be that hard to keep them in line. After all, they do owe us greatly."
ATM_promise_of_atom_desc: "As we languished in the bombed-out hellscape of Bałuty, one vision, one goal heartened us in our struggle, gave us purpose, and a reason to keep fighting - the dream of an atomic Poland. Now that we stand as the undisputed masters of Łódzkie, there is nothing that our supporters await more than the fulfillment of this dream. We've kept the people in the dark long enough. It is time to reaffirm our commitment to our movement's foundational idea. It is time to start building our first reactor. While we have nary the resources nor the expertise, our situation simply does not afford us the ability to delay the project ad infinitum. If we wish to maintain any sense of accountability, we have to immediately start drawing up the plans for our megaproject's construction, even if actually pulling it off will strain us up to the breaking point. So, let's make our ambitions official and let fate bind us. Whether we succeed or not, this shall be our legacy."
ATM_reform_crusaders_desc: "The Crusaders have served us well. Their numerous acts of bravery and heroism will forever be remembered; enshrined and cherished in the stories of our improbable victory. And yet, as we widen our scope of operations, it becomes evident that their current structure is simply not up to the task. If we are to reunify the country, we will need a proper, modern army, not just poorly regulated partisans. To that end, to ensure appropriate discipline, doctrine, and training, we will officially induct the militias into our newly professionalized armed forces, turning them into the true vanguard of the atomic crusade. Sure, with the new standards, we might have to sort the wheat from the chaff, but with the near-endless stream of volunteers, we expect the transition to be nothing but seamless."
ATM_great_reduction_plan_desc: "Humanity can be a wasteful race, a parasite upon the planet, draining it of all resources and burning it through greenhouse gasses until, eventually, all life on the surface perishes. Our own actions have left our days numbered as we continue to reverse terraform the Earth, ignorant of our impending demise. The time for milquetoast responses and toothless speeches has long passed, so if mankind is to be saved, we have to take drastic action. From now on, on any land our soldiers reach, the carbon footprint shall be annihilated, reduced to zero until the whole country is at last ecologically sustainable. We're bound to ruffle plenty of feathers and will, at times, have to shoot ourselves in the foot by destroying crucial industries, but we're facing extinction and survival is non-negotiable."
ATM_free_ecologists_desc: "Though we've endured plenty of hardships, cowering for survival in the irradiated ruins of Bałuty, let there be no doubt - we are the lucky few. While we eked out a rudimentary existence among this harsh reality, our brethren toiled in the dark depths of the Bełchatów mines, without any breaks, away from the sunlight, dehumanized, until their bodies gave in and the shafts became their graves. To this day, plenty of our sympathizers remain shackled in these horrid conditions, unaware of the change that happened above. They work to feed a machine long out of order, in fear that if they ever stop, an undertaker will swiftly deliver their punishment. Their sentences are finally over, and we will free them and return them to the surface so they may at last rejoin society. If their minds haven't yet been broken, that is."
ATM_pentomic_battle_groups_desc: "Ever since the start of the atomic age, war has changed. With a new, all-powerful weapon looming over the combatants, capable of wiping out entire divisions with a single strike, slow, meticulous advances, and permanent positions have become a thing of the past. If we're to break through enemy lines before being annihilated by the power of the Atom, we have to fundamentally reform the structure of our armed forces, giving each battalion enough specialized equipment to conduct offensive operations on its own, without the need to depend on the support of other formations. That way, we'll be able to attack quickly, overwhelming our foes and dispersing before they can even consider a nuclear response. Stuck with their antiquated tactics, our enemies will be rendered helpless, left at the mercy of our spearheads."
ATM_message_from_berlin_desc: "Our recent success has undoubtedly resulted in increased notoriety, even outside Poland's borders. Many regard us with cautious optimism as a welcome change and our victory as one of the rare few positive stories emerging from the war-torn region. Some brave souls even attempted to pitch in for our noble cause. Yet, among this stream of reactions, a deafening silence persists - that of the Germans, the self-proclaimed 'Masters of Europe.' With their wealth of resources and interventionist policy, their opposition could singlehandedly crush all we have ever achieved. We expect no love from them; mere begrudging tolerance of our ascent would be more than enough. We already have plenty of enemies at home; we don't need to add another to the list. We can only hope they share this sentiment."
ATM_clearer_sky_desc: "For the first time in nearly a decade, the sun breaks through the clouds of smog. While the urban centers will likely continue to suffer for years to come, life on the periphery is slowly starting to once more feel almost... normal. The constant deafening churning of industrial machinery has given way to the peaceful hum of tractors, working diligently to prepare for the first harvest in a region reborn. Though the yields will likely be barely enough to provide basic sustenance, it is a sign of a new era nonetheless - as water squeezed from a stone, the building blocks of life scraped from a barren land. We have weathered the toughest of seasons, ensured our continued survival, and laid the groundwork for nature's slow revival. From behind the thick shroud that obscures us from the world, a faint glimmer now shines - a hope we've fully earned."
ATM_shadow_of_chernobyl_desc: "In 1986, on the 26th of April, the atomic cause within Poland died, presumably permanently. As the fateful reactor burned, spewing radiation all over Eastern Europe, waves of fear spread across our country, instilling a lifelong phobia of anything nuclear in the terrified population. Back then, few could have predicted the extent of this distrust, lasting for generations until Poland was eventually left on the wayside, addicted to coal. Since the catastrophe that defined the last decades of our energy mix, safety standards have largely gone up, and outputs have spiked, making it clear that nuclear energy is the only path forward in ending our reliance on fossil fuels. And yet, the people, still shell-shocked after the tragedy in Chernobyl tremble at the mere mention of our grand plans, sabotage our efforts, paint us as devils, evil agents who wish to bring forth another such disaster. In their hearts, that tragic day still lives on. If we're to go forward with the construction of our first reactor, we must find a way to ease their worries, lest we end up having to face the desperate masses head-on."
ATM_fallout_desc: "We've come a long way since our takeover of Łódzkie. What started as a barely noteworthy resistance group has since grown into one of the main contenders for Poland's reunification. Against all odds, we largely contained the damage caused by our predecessors and restored a semblance of harmony to a ruined region. Of course, now is not the time to rest on our laurels. We're still far from reaching our targets, and there are plenty of challenges on our way. The environment has yet to heal, the people rally against our policies, and foreign hawks prepare to strike when we least expect it. And yet, there is one thing we can celebrate. We're no longer just the cleanup crew, defined by our struggle against the Brotherhood's lingering legacy. From now on, our challenges, successes, and failures are our own. We have become the masters of our fate."

##Events##
atom_cw.1.t: "Local Warming"
atom_cw.1.desc: " - Halina, c'mere! The boss's almost started 'is speech.\n - As if his speeches were that interesting...\n - As if there was somethin' else to watch... - Robert bit back - Now, quit complaining!\n - Dear miners and all those who support the carbon cause - Ziemkiewicz started not caring about the couple's quarrel - Last years were tough for all of us. But a bright coal-fueled future is upon us. Especially, after we eliminated the foreign agents such as those atomic terrorists led by *zzz*.\nZiemkiewicz's exposé - as well as Robert's and Halina's quarrel - was ended with static.\n - The hell? - Halina's husband was sure the Brotherhood always ensured the best signal during Ziemkiewicz's speeches.\nRobert's surprise was even greater after three mysterious silhouettes appeared on the TV screen. As their broadcast stabilized, the couple and all of the Brotherhood subjects, who were watching the obligatory speech could see three men sitting in front of the desk. They were wearing para-military jackets and black balaclavas. Next to them, a black flag with a symbol of an atom was placed.\n - We have interrupted this broadcast to deliver the message to all Poles. The Brotherhood is destroying our country. They lie about the progress. The lack of smog, just take a breath outside. Their organization is built on lies and I can prove that - The man in the middle took off his mask, revealing the face of Jakub Wiech. That's right, ladies and gentlemen. I live. And I implore all those who are persecuted by the Brotherhood, and all of Poles willing to fight for the better future to rise against Ziemkiewicz's tyranny.\n The broadcast was stopped by static and 'no signal' text."

atom_cw.2.desc: "[Day 0 of the operation 'Black Beast']\n\n[4:30] The sabotage team gets into position.\n[5:30] The supply truck arrives at point Alpha. The sabotage team subdues the Brotherhood personnel and executes them.\n[6:30] The sabotage team, dressed in the Brotherhood uniforms we acquired beforehand, drives the truck full of C4 into the power plant supply storage.\n[6:35] Agent 'Judith' we blackmailed 3 months ago to work for us is the one to search the truck.\n[6:40] We park the truck and depart the facility.\n[7:00] We retreat to save distance and detonate to the charge.\n[7:45] We arrive at the rendezvous point to meet with the propaganda crew and 'Judith' to hand them payment.\n\nFinal notes: The mission proceeded as we planned and turned out to be a complete success. The chain reaction resulting from the exploding fuel in the supply storage sent a large portion of the power plant ablaze. We expect numerous blackouts in the Brotherhood's power grid and a decisive decline in their morale. Even if the Brotherhood tries to hide the Bełchatów attack the materials the propaganda crew filmed will ensure the wider public will know the truth."
