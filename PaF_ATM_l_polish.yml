POLITICS_WIECH_DESC: "In many ways, Jakub Wiech is the antithesis of Ziemkiewicz's teachings, the perfect boogeyman to pin all the blame for the Brotherhood's failures on. Though mountains of propaganda have long distorted nearly all of the journalist's ideals, labeling his band of misfits as pawns in some unknown global conspiracy to take down the 'last bastion of progress,' the true danger Wiech poses for Bełchatów's elite lies not in the differences, but the similarities between him and Ziemkiewicz. As a lifelong proponent of moderate conservatism, the journalist could have felt right at home in the state his nemesis created. Perhaps in another world, they could have been allies, but in a nation built on the dogma of coal's superiority, any suggestion to the contrary is nothing less than treasonous heresy. \n\nThough he was always unwelcome on the Brotherhood's territory, nothing could stop Wiech from exposing the truth about the dangers the faction posed not just to Poland but the entire world. Despite his life being at risk every time he spoke, the journalist railed on about the need for a transition from the rapidly depleting fossil fuels to the near-infinite, sustainable power of atom. Wherever he appeared, a following sprung up, clinging to his ideals for hope amidst Ziemkiewicz's growing fanaticism. Each speech, every citizen brought to the nuclear cause weakened the Brotherhood's regime, even if just a little, sparking hope for much-needed reform. Soon, however, the days of peacefully changing the minds of Łódzkie's citizens would be over as the region's overlords sought to crack down on what they viewed as a plague spreading through their lands. \n\nJakub Wiech never wished to be a leader, but without him, the nuclear movement would perish, violently snuffed out by Ziemkiewicz and his lackeys. Despite knowing what fate awaits him if he fails, the journalist ignited an open rebellion against the Brotherhood's forces, launching the Atomic Crusade to restore sanity to the voivodeship. Some might say the odds he faces are insurmountable, that he has only doomed his followers to serve as cannon fodder for the experienced paladins, but that has never deterred Wiech before. All his life, he has battled for the nuclear cause, and he will not relent now. Even if he has to die for it, his sacrifice will forever be immortalized."

An infinite abyss, pulling our gaze in, inviting us to stare longingly into its dark depths. If we're not careful, it will forever change us. We must keep it chained; limit its usage to only that which benefits without harm. Otherwise, the lust for power might overwhelm us. Yet, is it not a sin to refuse to ponder the limits of our strength? Especially now that we've reached the precipice of omnipotence? We could be gods amongst men... \nSo, what shall be our legacy?"

Rather than condemn ourselves to follow the murky path of utilitarian justifications, we'd much prefer to assume the position of benevolent keepers of the Atom's secrets, dispensing its benefits to the worthy and keeping those blinded by hate and ambition from unlocking its true potential.

In our grim reality, things often boil down to a simple principle - 'eat or be eaten,' and we've come too far to see everything slip through our fingers. Come what may, we'd rather be alive and feared than dead and revered. History's written by the victors anyway."

ATM_fission_desc: "After years of meticulous organization, we are ready to give the Brotherhood what they asked for. An Atomic Crusade. We believe it is not too late to save Poland from those carbon cooks. But first our cause needs to gain popular support by exposing, the Brotherhood's lies. And there's no better way to expose those lies, than to issue a proclamation by a 'long-dead' Jakub Wiech."
ATM_supplies_from_lodz_desc: "Although we only recently decided to launch an armed resistance against the Brotherhood, we've been preparing for the uprising for a long time. We've established many hidden supply cashes in the urban jungle of Łódź and even the current occupation of the city by the Brotherhood didn't compromise the safety of our contraband. We can finally put our concealed weapons to good use now that we decided to fight for our cause."
ATM_apocalyptic_roads_desc: "As the Brotherhoods conquests grew, so did their complecency. The armed escort protecting their convoys became lighter and lighter as the illusion of safety became ingrained in the Paladins' minds. Now that we've risen against them, we can exploit their lowered guard and claim their supplies for our own."
ATM_strike_at_nucleus_desc: "We knew this day would come. The Bełchatów Power Plant - all that was a thorn in the side of every ecologist even before the Fall. Efficiency be damned, the Paladins made a symbol to rally behind. Now it is time to crush this symbol. What's important is that we show the populus that even the places most sacred to the Brotherhood are not invulnerable. That would be enough as we can't destroy the whole facility with sabotagists only. Not that we would want to as Wiech seems to have his own plans regarding the future of the power plant."
ATM_reach_the_dissidents_desc: "The inner machinations of the council are... murky at best. The four Paladins cloistered themselves in a porcelain tower. There appear to be some cracks in their structure. While the other members burn like their beloved coal with passion against the atom, Gadomski has always been an outsider, whether it comes to fervor, journalistic background, or economic policies. We have to proceed with great caution as we don't want to compromise our intelligence. However, there's a great chance we can reach him and convince him to help us navigate the difunctional machine that is Brotherhood's economy."
ATM_black_market_connections_desc: "Our way of life in the underground prevents us from specializing in any particular field. Our agents have to be self-sufficient and adaptive. As such, we haven't been able to train any specialized weapon smugglers. We'll need some outside help to provide us with more advanced weaponry. It's time to deal with the weapon dealers in the black market."
ATM_makeshift_workshops_desc: "The Brotherhood's structure may not be as rotten as we thought. The first encounter with their soldiers proved the war may need more equipment than the one we hid in Łódź or bought from the black market. We'll need production centers and we'll need them fast. The makeshift workshops won't provide the best stuff but it should suffice to fill the holes in our supply chain for the time being."
ATM_god_particles_desc: "Appeal to old Razemites' love for atom. Point to the usage of nuclear power by Israel. Claim you give them the chance to fight Azazel himself! I don't know what else can you do to convince the Widzew Jews to help us, but surely our diplomats can figure something out. Have them study Talmud to get some clues maybe. Just don't be stereotypical by trying to bribe them. Unless that's necessary."
ATM_red_forest_desc: "This should be easy. If there's the faction that hates Ziemkiewicz's reign as much as we do, it's got to be the nature-loving scouts. Not sure how they view nuclear energy given their obscurantism, but even they'll have to see we're at least the lesser of two evils.\nAnd if we can't convince the forest-worshippers that the potentially biggest polluters of the 21st century are evil... Well, we may as well call off the whole crusade."
ATM_nuclear_commando_desc: "There must be some of Sapkowski's lackeys to recycle to gain an advantage. While the worshippers of the Eternal Flame are most likely to have joined the Brotherhood due to their strongly conservative outlook, knightly aesthetic, and love for burning things, it's safe to assume we should be at least somewhat successful with recruiting the more progressive and ecological Scoia’tael. Those savages can even treat atomic energy as some kind of magic for all we know."
ATM_send_the_courier_desc: "As the most densely populated area in the voivodeship, it should be easy to gain much support in Łódź. Not to mention it's easier to infiltrate a large city where you can make yourself disappear than some village. We just need to send one of our agents, disguised as a simple courier to gather the dispersed rebel cells and lead the assault securing the fortified positions built by Hołownia's government."
ATM_blood_money_desc: "Skrzydlewski and his family can't be happy about the state of his flowers under the Brotherhood's regime. Even if he can compensate for that loss by the increased demand for funerals due to lung diseases, we should scare him with the looming danger of nationalization at the whim of Ziemkiewicz. Couple those arguments with some bribes now and the promise of more once we take the voivodeship and we're at home. The squarehead should listen to his boss, just stay away from the third guy."

ATM_decarbonization_desc: "It's... over. The Brotherhood has fallen. We've long dreaded the moment the guns finally go silent, as by all means, we should have been the vanquished. And yet, we stand victorious, with a country to run and our former enemies to judge. Only now that the drums of war have stopped beating and the euphoria of triumph subdued has the sheer scale of the damage become evident. We rule over ruins and wastelands, smog-covered cities, and fields unfit for cultivation. Carbon has destroyed Łódzkie, scarring the land far worse than the bomb could have ever done. Now, the real work begins to undo the devastation so willingly embraced by our predecessors. Though in its dying throes, it has entrenched itself into the ecosystem and the people's minds, the darkness of carbon shall give way to the light of atom."
ATM_brother_ziemkiewicz_desc: "Oh, how wonderfully have the tables turned. Our greatest enemy, the face of the Brotherhood, the man who tried to root us all out, now finds himself at our mercy.  The recent string of defeats has exposed Ziemkiewicz for who he really is - a raving lunatic lost in his own delusions of grandeur. Aside from serving as his clique's figurehead, he held little true power, overshadowed by his more methodical puppet masters. As tempting as it may be to fully exact our revenge, there is one thing we have to acknowledge - Ziemkiewicz is no threat. Still, the lives lost due to his mad ramblings must be avenged, and our supporters chant in unison for a particular verdict - death. A little bit of leniency could go a long way toward rehabilitating our more moderate opponents, but can we really let such a monster live after all the suffering he's caused us?"
ATM_brother_warzecha_desc: "Of all our fallen foes, none deserves immediate retribution more than 'Paladin' Warzecha - the true architect of the Brotherhood's system of cruelty and exploitation. For years, the little rat cowered behind his more popular colleagues, pulling the strings of Poland's destruction from behind the scenes. Every decision that set Bełchatów's clique further down its dark path has a paper trail leading back to one man - the embodiment of all of the Brotherhood's worst qualities. Warzecha is irredeemable. Given another chance, he'd gladly do it all over again, damning millions to live in a polluted wasteland without ever losing that smug little grin of his. The verdict has already been decided. The bastard has to die for his crimes, and we'll gladly watch the sentence carried out, filled with a particular sense of satisfaction."
ATM_deindoctrination_desc: "Besides the environmental disaster rapidly unfolding before us, another, more humanitarian tragedy has entrenched itself. The constant stream of unchallenged propaganda spewed out by the Brotherhood's news outlets has whittled down the minds of the populace, turning them into willing participants in their own nation's suicide. They cling to the teachings of their clueless masters, embracing policies that will destroy all they've ever known as dogma. Though even if they oppose us, they're not our enemies, but victims, broken and in need of guidance. Convincing them of the righteousness of our ways will be a long and arduous process, but through baby steps, we'll help them break free from the lies once more."
ATM_saving_polish_microclimates_desc: "Flowers wither in the chemically polluted ground. Contaminated rivers flow through forests of stumps. Wild beasts starve as their food chain lies broken. Poland stands amid a total, self-inflicted, environmental collapse - one that will take the combined effort of multiple generations to offset. We inherited a region destroyed by unchecked industrial expansion to a point where the constant need for more resources threatened not just the balance of the ecosystem, but the survival of the population altogether. As much as we need it, there is sadly no miraculous solution, only a slow, difficult recovery. To that end, we must form a governmental climate agency to assess what has been lost, what can still be saved, and where we can pour our funds to really make a change. Little by little, nature will return, even if just a shadow of its former self."
ATM_acknowledge_global_warming_desc: "Long gone are the days when fearsome winters gripped Poland, and a blanket of snow covered the land for months on end. But the images of snowball fights and downhill sled races are not just a case of nostalgia towards the blissful days of youth, and neither is their disappearance a coincidence, but an example of something greater, something far more sinister - climate change. For too long has the government blankly rejected all evidence of humanity's disastrous effects on the environment, all while actively contributing to the process's acceleration. No more. We are all complicit in mankind's greatest crime against nature, and it's high time we take responsibility for the damage we've caused. In a war against the Earth, there can be no victors, so if there is to be any future for our life on this planet, we will all do our part to finally make things right."
ATM_destroy_malicious_media_desc: "In the Brotherhood, only one truth existed, diligently spewed out by a myriad of government-funded publications. Though they attempted to discern themselves and pretended to be more than just thoughtless propaganda tubes, they shared one thing in common - the lack of any journalistic integrity in their advocacy for Ziemkiewicz's harmful policies. While it will take a long time to combat the misinformation already implanted into the citizens' heads, we can at least stop its further spread.  The major media conglomerates, such as the madman's beloved 'Do Rzeczy' will be broken up and replaced with a number of independent papers promoting our narrative. The lesser outlets will continue operating,   albeit under heavy scrutiny and anti-coal bend to deradicalize their readers. The war for the people's minds has only begun, and these publications will serve as our frontline soldiers."
ATM_industrial_cults_desc: "Not even an institution as sacred as the Church found itself spared of the meddling of Ziemkiewicz's cronies, bastardized into a twisted form of itself that spread not the word of God, but the clique's industrialist agenda. After years of such dogma spewing from the altars, many of the more devout have started worshiping coal as their Golden Calf. They pray to it, surround themselves with it, tout its glory in hidden meetings. We must restore the church back to its former glory and rid it of these corrupt influences by rehabilitating the disgraced pastors who refused to cooperate in the corruption of their flock. Eventually, we will bring the lost lambs back to their holy shepherd. So help us God."
ATM_brother_rzymkowski_desc: "Just like lambs spared from the slaughter, so too are we gathered to pass judgment on our former killer. All the massacres, all the war crimes, everything can be traced back to one man - the butcher of Bełchatów, Paladin Rzymkowski. While many of our foes, shorn of their commander's protection, claim to have been merely following orders, this genocidal maniac's tactics had nothing to do with war. Had he gotten his way, each and every last one of us would've ended up six feet under, with a bullet to the back of the head to end their struggle and a mass grave to bury their legacy. There is no punishment fit for this bastard except that which he so willingly dispensed. There will be no second chances, only the satisfaction of our brethren's lives avenged. Rzymkowski does not deserve more."
ATM_brotherhood_arms_industry_desc: "Now that the Brotherhood's war machine has been stopped, only the factories that fueled it remain, some dormant, some still working to supply the fallen behemoth. The military industry left behind by our fallen foes is impressive, but it is misguided at best. Just like the whole state it armed - wasteful beyond belief. All it did was suck further resources out of the already depleted region, bringing the environmental doomsday clock closer to midnight with each shell produced. The only way to stop this system of exploitation is to curtail it across the board. We have more than enough factories as it is. We will cut production down to what we truly need, and get rid of all unnecessary assembly lines and projects, at least until we figure out a way to somehow make them sustainable."
ATM_dissolve_paladin_hierarchy_desc: "In the Brotherhood, earning the title of Paladin was perhaps the highest achievement in an officer's career. And yet, none knew precisely what that rank meant. Some served as field commanders, some as administrators, others even as simple guards. Though they may hold the same moniker, no two Paladins are of the same status. Maintaining such an uneven and unorganized structure of military leadership can only lead to further chaos, especially as we integrate our own units into it. Therefore, we must restore a tried-and-tested structure within the army, drawing from the traditional ranks of the once-mighty Polish armed forces as our basis. Unlike our enemies, we'll maintain a clear hierarchy with a well-defined chain of command and a fluid stream of promotion that will guarantee us a steady supply of both junior and senior officers, not just a bunch of lifelong appointees to the one exalted, all-encompassing position."
ATM_amnesty_for_officers_desc: "Not all of the generals we faced in our recent conflict are ideological fanatics. Some are simply spineless sellswords, willing to offer their services to anyone as long as it furthers their careers and brings a healthy stream of funds back into their pockets. While normally we'd steer clear of such snakes, regrettably, our army does suffer from a lack of higher leadership. We don't have nearly enough time to train our own loyal cadres, leaving us with only one option - take in the officers willing to fight for our cause, or rather coin. We'll heavily peer through their resumes, and make them swear oaths to fight for the glory of Atom, but ultimately, their loyalty is like a pennant in the wind - it turns in whatever direction fate currently blows. If we ever fall on hard times, they'll abandon us without a second thought."
ATM_nucleation_desc: "Now that we've got the foundation set, it's time to start adopting our new structure. Setting up a functional military administration from scratch is no easy task, especially when you also have to clean up someone else's mess at the same time. With our meager resources and in record time, we need to set up a central command, establish garrison posts across the entire region, and build training centers to prepare for the influx of new recruits. The task ahead seems herculean, but at least we don't have to face it alone. Some of the former Brotherhood officers under our employ have at least a basic understanding of how such a system should function. This is their chance to prove their worth."
ATM_long_road_to_normality_desc: "Let there be no doubt. We are deeply indebted to our partisans. They've proven their worth in battle beyond all expectations, but regrettably, untrained guerilla formations are not a scalable model fit for established states like ours. The absence of regulation is one thing, but the main issue is the lack of any standardized training regimen. In our last war, we often had to resort to sending anyone who knew how to shoot straight into combat. It's only through sheer luck and enemy incompetence that our forces pulled through. Things won't be so easy from now on. We're up against established regimes, often backed by remnants of the once-fiersome Army. If we're to stand against them, we'll need our troops thoroughly drilled to the highest standards. No more slacking off. There's war on the horizon, and this time we'll be prepared."
ATM_stop_ridiculous_army_programs_desc: "Wonder weapons - eye candy of dictators, vain representations of their fetishization of power. Given the Brotherhood's megalomanic aspirations, it's no wonder they wasted a large chunk of their budget on impractical, unachievable projects that would supposedly lay waste to their enemies. Multiple industrial complexes operated for that reason alone, wasting copious amounts of manpower and resources constructing unusable junk that now litters their warehouses. From now on, all such vanity projects will be halted, and all failed prototypes scrapped for parts. We don't expect to find much useful, but in our situation, every loose cog matters. Once the trash has been cleared out, we'll repurpose the assembly lines to produce materials that could actually boost both our war effort and the population's well-being, no longer chasing impossible dreams of unmatched power. It's time for some responsibility around here."
ATM_brother_gadomski_desc: "Paladin Gadomski is a snake, an opportunist, willing to betray all he holds dear to save his position. He held no love for the Brotherhood's dogma, and he jumped ship as soon as any real danger arose. Normally, we'd steer clear of such untrustworthy individuals, but the sad truth is - we have no other choice. Out of the handful of paladins willing to cooperate with us to any degree, none knows the inner workings of the Brotherhood quite like Gadomski. Whether we like it or not, we need his expertise to refit its industrial machine and get everything up and running again. Luckily, the spineless coward has already ingratiated himself with much of our higher leadership by aiding us in the struggle against his former colleagues. Therefore, the plan is simple - a slap on the wrist to appease the masses and a cushy position once the sentence concludes."
ATM_redemption_for_civilian_sector_desc: "Having inherited the region from our former foes, we are inevitably forced to make do with whatever industry they deemed fit to leave us. Normally, we'd appreciate being able to build upon an already-functional system, but the Brotherhood's civilian sector is simply irredeemable. The few little embers of independent economic activity that remain exist only to fuel the suicidal system of resource exploitation and keep the population servile and dependent on the meager services provided. To break the disastrous cycle we need a complete refit, and for that - the expertise of someone who helped bring about this system in the first place. Gadomski does not deserve our attention, but he might just be our only chance to fix this mess. If he can find a way to turn the situation around, we might be lenient enough to grant him redemption."
ATM_repopulate_the_countryside_desc: "All over the region, empty houses dot the landscape, slowly decaying without their rightful owners. Under Ziemkiewicz's regime, thousands have been forcefully estranged from their countryside homes to feed the Brotherhood's industrial regime, and now that sanity has prevailed, it's time for them to finally return. Whether by their own means or with our help, the people will be reunited with their former possessions, allowing them to once more embrace their traditional ways of life. Though the fields they once toiled have most likely been dug up and left desecrated in search of any natural resources beneath, we'll give them whatever subsidies they need to get back on their feet. It's the least we can do for them after all the pain they've endured."
ATM_fight_the_smog_desc: "Though the Brotherhood's mad pursuit of industrial expansion at all costs has been violently halted, a relic of their ways persists in the very air we breathe. One can hardly exit their apartment without choking on the leftover smog, haunting us like a specter of our past sins against the environment. If we fail to quickly root it out, the damage might become permanent, forever turning central Poland into an uninhabitable wasteland. No matter how many resources it will take, we must remove this lingering poison so that one day, the sun's rays may once again shine over Bełchatów, free from deadly clouds that confine the city to darkness."
ATM_revitalize_agrarian_industry_desc: "After years of misuse, chemical pollution, and near-constant warfare, the once-fertile fields of our region have largely turned bare.  The few plots that weathered the harsh conditions have since been destroyed to make way for further industrial expansion. Thanks to the Brotherhood's lack of foresight, or rather its complete indifference toward the plight of its starving population, we're left with solitary, scattered patches of arable farmland on the outskirts of the voivodeship, where the machinery had yet to reach. As dire as the situation may seem, however, not all is lost. The most resilient strains have adapted to the unwelcoming climate. If we manage to plant their seeds across our territory, some may yet bear fruit. We'll use whatever spare funds we have to subsidize the ailing farmers and help them cultivate what remains of their lands. Hopefully, in time, they'll be able to support themselves once more."
ATM_green_is_back_on_menu_desc: "Though we've managed to restore a somewhat steady supply of fruits and vegetables to our markets, it seems we're faced with yet another problem - the lack of any actual demand. After years of anti-vegetarian propaganda, the people of Łódzkie have come to treat any natural products as outright harmful, ascribing all sorts of made-up health risks and conditions to even the simplest of plants. As ridiculous as it may sound, we need to go back to the drawing board and dispel these harmful myths, incentivizing the consumption of vegetables at all costs, even at a significant loss to our coffers. Our people are like toddlers, throwing a fit against the flavors they've come to forget. Just like their parents taught them to love plant-based food once, so too will we educate them to enjoy it again."
ATM_brother_janecki_desc: "Few names evoke as much fear within our ranks as that of Paladin Janecki. The grey eminence of the Brotherhood has long wreaked havoc among our sympathizers, meticulously picking us off one by one like a hunter silently stalking his prey. While we may have broken the shackles of his influence, the distrust sown by his infiltrators permeates our structure until this very day. Now that all his dark machinations have fallen through and he stands trial for his numerous crimes, the shadow no longer looms so large, reduced to a pitiful, powerless visage. Still, voices of those who lost family, friends, and comrades to Janecki's vicious persecutions clamor for their oppressor's death, demanding vengeance regardless of the rule of law. But can they be blamed? What mercy can there possibly be for such a monster?"
ATM_proctor_secret_files_desc: "A figure such as Janecki does not stay in power through the goodwill of his superiors alone. There was little reason for anyone in the Brotherhood's highest circles to trust him, yet fewer to not replace him with someone more loyal and predictable. There can be only one explanation. They feared opposing him, and for that to be the case, the damn spider needed to have dirt on everyone worth their salt. He must have written it all down somewhere. If we can get our hands on this information, we could easily keep his former colleagues in check. Besides, he might have even gone far enough to have something damning on our own leadership. It's better to be safe than sorry. We'll search through all his leftover possessions, leaving no stone unturned. If he has the files stashed away somewhere, we will eventually find them. Better us than our enemies."
ATM_secret_service_apparatus_desc: "While the Brotherhood's legacy is largely that of failure, there is one thing we have to give to them - they knew how to keep dissidents, both domestic and foreign, in check. Janecki was no fool. The organization he established is a spy's wet dream, able to wriggle its tendrils into the tiniest of cracks in search of any unrest. In the ever-shifting political landscape of post-Fall Poland, where loyalties often change on a whim, we'd be wise to repurpose the agency to suit our needs. Of course, we don't strive for nearly the same level of brutality and terror as the former director, but it still wouldn't hurt appropriating some of his more effective methods of control. Some may call us hypocritical, some may turn their backs on us, but while resuming the invasive campaign of state-sponsored invigilation won't get us any allies, it will ensure something far more important - survival."
ATM_cleanse_the_ranks_desc: "Though our efforts to repurpose the Brotherhood’s secret services have thus far yielded acceptable results, it seems the ideological rot Janecki instilled into every level of his beloved organization goes deeper than we could have possibly predicted. From the lowest clerks to the highest officers, this infection has reached all, turning them into sleeper agents against our cause. While they may diligently perform their tasks for now, who knows what sort of dirt they’re digging up on our leaders behind their backs, like a hornets' nest of traitors just waiting to be stirred? There can be no half-measures. This growing tumor will be excised before they have a chance to strike, even if it means replacing the entire agency with untrained loyalists."
ATM_stop_the_persecutions_desc: "After many years under the Brotherhood's jackboot, the people of Łódzkie have learned one emotion - fear. Janecki's network of spies dug deep, violently exposing the slightest traces of dissent or even doubt in the enforced doctrine. A cruel fate awaited those who dared speak up, as sometimes just a couple of poorly framed words over family dinners became grounds for a person's swift termination. And while a certain degree of order must be maintained, we cannot let such a brutal policy continue, not after it resulted in the deaths of so many of our ecologist comrades. We will do the right thing and loosen the reins so the persecuted dissidents will at last be able to come out of hiding. The dark clouds of tyranny are about to be dispelled."
ATM_bring_the_dissidents_desc: "Despite the Brotherhood portraying itself as an ideological monolith, it seems not all of its former members are beyond reproach. Aside from a large contingent of ideologues unceremoniously shunned for their opposition to the organization's radical turn, it seems even within the established ranks, a full-blown reformist wing took hold, spearheaded by the youthful passion and pragmatism of Roksana Węgiel. They may not agree with us completely, but their knowledge of this government's inner workings might prove indispensable in our quest to undo its most harmful policies. It's a shot in the dark, but it's better than doing nothing. Regardless of our opinions, we should at least make some diplomatic overtures to see if a partnership is at all possible. We'd rather have them on our side than face Europe's largest environmental crisis on our own."
ATM_greenpeace_poland_desc: "Few organizations have a reputation as controversial as Greenpeace. In many ways, their ideals contradict ours, and their opposition to nuclear energy has long been a thorn in the side of any legitimate environmental movement. Even now, we don't expect them to hold much love for our ideas on how to handle the crises at hand. Some may call it foolish to empower an organization so vehemently opposed to our state's core vision, but in our fight to stave off doomsday, we need all hands on deck. Surely, the activists will appreciate being able to finally come out of hiding, free from persecution, and given a near-blank cheque to resume their climate advocacy. They can grumble about our nuclear dreams internally all they want as long as they stay in their lane and don't interfere. It shouldn't be that hard to keep them in line. After all, they do owe us greatly."
ATM_promise_of_atom_desc: "As we languished in the bombed-out hellscape of Bałuty, one vision, one goal heartened us in our struggle, gave us purpose, and a reason to keep fighting - the dream of an atomic Poland. Now that we stand as the undisputed masters of Łódzkie, there is nothing that our supporters await more than the fulfillment of this dream. We've kept the people in the dark long enough. It is time to reaffirm our commitment to our movement's foundational idea. It is time to start building our first reactor. While we have nary the resources nor the expertise, our situation simply does not afford us the ability to delay the project ad infinitum. If we wish to maintain any sense of accountability, we have to immediately start drawing up the plans for our megaproject's construction, even if actually pulling it off will strain us up to the breaking point. So, let's make our ambitions official and let fate bind us. Whether we succeed or not, this shall be our legacy."
ATM_reform_crusaders_desc: "The Crusaders have served us well. Their numerous acts of bravery and heroism will forever be remembered; enshrined and cherished in the stories of our improbable victory. And yet, as we widen our scope of operations, it becomes evident that their current structure is simply not up to the task. If we are to reunify the country, we will need a proper, modern army, not just poorly regulated partisans. To that end, to ensure appropriate discipline, doctrine, and training, we will officially induct the militias into our newly professionalized armed forces, turning them into the true vanguard of the atomic crusade. Sure, with the new standards, we might have to sort the wheat from the chaff, but with the near-endless stream of volunteers, we expect the transition to be nothing but seamless."
ATM_great_reduction_plan_desc: "Humanity can be a wasteful race, a parasite upon the planet, draining it of all resources and burning it through greenhouse gasses until, eventually, all life on the surface perishes. Our own actions have left our days numbered as we continue to reverse terraform the Earth, ignorant of our impending demise. The time for milquetoast responses and toothless speeches has long passed, so if mankind is to be saved, we have to take drastic action. From now on, on any land our soldiers reach, the carbon footprint shall be annihilated, reduced to zero until the whole country is at last ecologically sustainable. We're bound to ruffle plenty of feathers and will, at times, have to shoot ourselves in the foot by destroying crucial industries, but we're facing extinction and survival is non-negotiable."
ATM_free_ecologists_desc: "Though we've endured plenty of hardships, cowering for survival in the irradiated ruins of Bałuty, let there be no doubt - we are the lucky few. While we eked out a rudimentary existence among this harsh reality, our brethren toiled in the dark depths of the Bełchatów mines, without any breaks, away from the sunlight, dehumanized, until their bodies gave in and the shafts became their graves. To this day, plenty of our sympathizers remain shackled in these horrid conditions, unaware of the change that happened above. They work to feed a machine long out of order, in fear that if they ever stop, an undertaker will swiftly deliver their punishment. Their sentences are finally over, and we will free them and return them to the surface so they may at last rejoin society. If their minds haven't yet been broken, that is."
ATM_pentomic_battle_groups_desc: "Ever since the start of the atomic age, war has changed. With a new, all-powerful weapon looming over the combatants, capable of wiping out entire divisions with a single strike, slow, meticulous advances, and permanent positions have become a thing of the past. If we're to break through enemy lines before being annihilated by the power of the Atom, we have to fundamentally reform the structure of our armed forces, giving each battalion enough specialized equipment to conduct offensive operations on its own, without the need to depend on the support of other formations. That way, we'll be able to attack quickly, overwhelming our foes and dispersing before they can even consider a nuclear response. Stuck with their antiquated tactics, our enemies will be rendered helpless, left at the mercy of our spearheads."
ATM_message_from_berlin_desc: "Our recent success has undoubtedly resulted in increased notoriety, even outside Poland's borders. Many regard us with cautious optimism as a welcome change and our victory as one of the rare few positive stories emerging from the war-torn region. Some brave souls even attempted to pitch in for our noble cause. Yet, among this stream of reactions, a deafening silence persists - that of the Germans, the self-proclaimed 'Masters of Europe.' With their wealth of resources and interventionist policy, their opposition could singlehandedly crush all we have ever achieved. We expect no love from them; mere begrudging tolerance of our ascent would be more than enough. We already have plenty of enemies at home; we don't need to add another to the list. We can only hope they share this sentiment."
ATM_clearer_sky_desc: "For the first time in nearly a decade, the sun breaks through the clouds of smog. While the urban centers will likely continue to suffer for years to come, life on the periphery is slowly starting to once more feel almost... normal. The constant deafening churning of industrial machinery has given way to the peaceful hum of tractors, working diligently to prepare for the first harvest in a region reborn. Though the yields will likely be barely enough to provide basic sustenance, it is a sign of a new era nonetheless - as water squeezed from a stone, the building blocks of life scraped from a barren land. We have weathered the toughest of seasons, ensured our continued survival, and laid the groundwork for nature's slow revival. From behind the thick shroud that obscures us from the world, a faint glimmer now shines - a hope we've fully earned."
ATM_shadow_of_chernobyl_desc: "In 1986, on the 26th of April, the atomic cause within Poland died, presumably permanently. As the fateful reactor burned, spewing radiation all over Eastern Europe, waves of fear spread across our country, instilling a lifelong phobia of anything nuclear in the terrified population. Back then, few could have predicted the extent of this distrust, lasting for generations until Poland was eventually left on the wayside, addicted to coal. Since the catastrophe that defined the last decades of our energy mix, safety standards have largely gone up, and outputs have spiked, making it clear that nuclear energy is the only path forward in ending our reliance on fossil fuels. And yet, the people, still shell-shocked after the tragedy in Chernobyl tremble at the mere mention of our grand plans, sabotage our efforts, paint us as devils, evil agents who wish to bring forth another such disaster. In their hearts, that tragic day still lives on. If we're to go forward with the construction of our first reactor, we must find a way to ease their worries, lest we end up having to face the desperate masses head-on."
ATM_fallout_desc: "We've come a long way since our takeover of Łódzkie. What started as a barely noteworthy resistance group has since grown into one of the main contenders for Poland's reunification. Against all odds, we largely contained the damage caused by our predecessors and restored a semblance of harmony to a ruined region. Of course, now is not the time to rest on our laurels. We're still far from reaching our targets, and there are plenty of challenges on our way. The environment has yet to heal, the people rally against our policies, and foreign hawks prepare to strike when we least expect it. And yet, there is one thing we can celebrate. We're no longer just the cleanup crew, defined by our struggle against the Brotherhood's lingering legacy. From now on, our challenges, successes, and failures are our own. We have become the masters of our fate."

ATM_heart_of_baluty_desc: "Swapping one set of problems for another doesn’t mean things get any easier. The immediate threats may be gone, but our prospects still remain rather bleak. The respite provided by the serenity of our bunker headquarters takes away from the cruel reality at hand - we’ve got a mountain to climb. Our projects are progressing far too slowly, the people and our former allies resent us, while our nosy Western neighbor, the wannabe European hegemon keeps prodding ever further into our business. As much as we’d like to take our foot off the gas for just a little while, we’re stuck in an endless spiral that keeps forcing us to constantly make our next move. Dark clouds are gathering over Poland, just as we were finally getting back on our feet, but we’ve weathered many storms, and this will be no different. Let’s get to work."
ATM_green_fury_desc: "Oh, what irony for a nation such as ours to suffer the ecologists' wrath. We've done everything right thus far, and yet, their discontent only grows. You can dedicate yourself to the environment, cripple your economic growth to combat climate change, but in the eyes of some, you'll never shake off the mantle of 'atomic terrorists.'  It's funny, really, what damage a simple disagreement can do. Being labeled as villains ain't nothing new, though it does sting coming from our former allies. We can't afford to have the activists sabotaging all our nuclear investments. The matter is too crucial. Our hands are tied, so for now, we'll simply proceed without them. Maybe if we ignore their hostile rhetoric, they'll tire themselves out, and all will go back to normal. After all, there isn't much a bunch of disorganized environmentalists can do to threaten us."
ATM_monsters_we_create_desc: "Well, apparently there is quite a lot they can do. We've expected nasty slogans and picket fences, but the Greenpeace fanatics have really crossed the line this time. In a way, we're partly to blame for this tragedy. We never should have given them this much power and free rein. The culprits have since withdrawn into hiding, evading all justice. They've shown they have no qualms about committing wanton terror in defense of their precious little ideals. They have embarked upon a warpath, and they will strike again. But, unlike the way they paint us, we're no monsters. Our predecessors would have killed the activists in cold blood, smoking them out one by one until the final traces of resistance had been snuffed out. However, we will not sit still as they take out our people. Something must be done, and if Greenpeace refuses to yield, we'll have to take care of things the hard way."
ATM_appeal_to_the_un_desc: "The anti-nuclear activists will never listen to our voice of reason. Even though our broad goals align, they refuse to pay heed to a single word uttered by 'puppets of Big Atom.' Luckily, there is one greater authority, far larger and more influential than our state, that these rabble-rousers continue to uphold as a moral standard. The UN has never been particularly friendly to our cause, infiltrated by the same misguided breed that continues causing trouble within our borders, but it has thus far been somewhat reasonable in its critique. We have our differences, but if we could establish contact and urge them to recognize us as worthwhile allies, it might be enough to cool down the tempers at home. Surely they'll see the benefits of working together over wasting precious time and resources squabbling with one another."
ATM_fruitless_effort_desc: "The United Nations has rebuffed us! How ironic that they claim the mantle of 'defenders of peace' yet the one time they can actually make an impact, they choose to back the insurgents actively devastating our territory. Over what? The petulant refusal to admit atomic energy's necessity in the climate struggle? Greta has to be out of her damn mind to think she's doing the right thing here. In her refusal to condemn them, she just passively legitimized the rebels' cause. This will only embolden them to conduct further acts of terror against our innocent supporters. Has there not been enough suffering and death already? Fine, if the UN is not on board, we'll handle the matter ourselves. They can lodge all the diplomatic protests they want. If they wanted a say in the matter, they should have taken our side."
ATM_strike_for_climate_desc: "As if a handful of dissidents wasn't enough, it appears the Greenpeace fanatics managed to turn a large portion of the population against us. Stoking fears of a potential nuclear catastrophe, they riled up our citizens enough for them to launch a large-scale campaign of civil disobedience. Within hours, nearly all production has ground to a halt, and even basic services have ceased to function. Our industrial system, so carefully built up over the past years, crumbled like an unsteady house of cards from a single gust of wind. Without crucial goods, the situation could soon turn critical once our emergency stockpiles run dry and the shortages fuel the flames of dissent. One way or another, we need to get the people back to their job sites. Even if it requires heavy concessions, we can't afford even a moment of delay, lest all our past efforts burn before our very eyes."
ATM_meeting_with_strikers_desc: "Even though they're actively paralyzing our nation, the majority of the strikers are not villains. They have been deceived, lied to by hostile influences, but they can be persuaded to return to the right path, and we'll forgive them and welcome them back into the fold as our prodigal sons. For that to take place, however, we first need to convince them to drop this charade so that life can return to normal. We've managed to secure a direct line of communication with the strike leaders. If we can get them to sit down with us and find a working compromise, the whole situation could be over in no time. Their fears are overblown, and if only they listen to reason and our copious amounts of prepared data, they will see the foolishness of their action. By the time we're done, they'll turn into our staunchest allies."
ATM_oh_the_irony_desc: "Well, they're even more pissed now, how lovely. Apparently, they didn't appreciate being bashed over the head with our pro-nuclear lectures. While they were willing to negotiate before, they now claim they'll never acquiesce to the demands of 'atomic terrorists,' outright demanding our deposition. The situation is worsening by the minute, and the threat of shortages looms large. Each day, new souls join the protests, which quickly spiral beyond any control. We need to act fast if we're to contain them. Our options are limited and we've already tried handling things the peaceful way. We don't want to set the precedent that dissent will be dismantled through the use of force, but we've been left with no other choice. We need to think this over. Maybe another solution will present itself, but the prospect seems increasingly less likely. There might only be one way forward. One we always wished to avoid."
ATM_at_least_fair_trial_desc: "So, it's come to this then. If we can't get the dissenters to cooperate, we'll have to forcefully break their resolve. We've tried everything, but it seems history has condemned us to be no better than the brutal regimes that came before us. As much as it pains us to have to carry out this sentence, our vision far outweighs the demands of the rebellious masses. We can't let them destroy all our hard work in pursuit of their foolish vision. The usage of nuclear energy is non-negotiable, and a handful of misguided activists won't change that. Through its destructive actions, the loudest contingent of rebels has sealed its fate. Without them, the rest should promptly disperse. There's no honor in convicting someone who fights for a noble cause, no matter how misled they may be. If we can't be lenient, let us at least be fair. This madness has to end."
ATM_suffocating_smoke_desc: "The dark clouds of smog prove time and time again to be more resilient than we could've possibly imagined. No matter what policies we set to combat the leftover airborne pollution, they grip desperately onto the skies, hide behind dark corners, and loom ominously over the same factories that once gave them birth. Like a wounded animal desperately scrambling for survival, the grey fog seems to retaliate against us in anger, descending onto urban areas and enclosing them in a suffocating capsule that continues to claim numerous lives of our citizens. And yet, with each passing month, the clouds' edges shrivel, and a trace of blue breaks through the vast gloomy seas of smoke. The great reduction plan is bearing fruit, and eventually, we'll eradicate the smog's final remnants, but if we are to live to see that day, we need to greatly accelerate its progress."
ATM_water_desc: "Our polluted rivers aren't so useless after all. Even when contaminated with tonnes of trash from every factory on their paths, their current still carries something invaluable - energy. So far, we've been rather slow and inefficient when it comes to harvesting this nearly infinite stream of free power. After all, constructing appropriate infrastructure is quite a heavy financial burden. Yet, as we inch ever closer to complete reliance on renewable energy, we can no longer neglect one of its primary sources. Poland is a land of rivers, perfectly capable of providing for us all. We must recognize these gifts of nature and build hydroelectric plants wherever the terrain allows it. It will be costly at first, but with proper planning and maintenance, we might finally be able to do away with the harmful coal-based systems left over from the previous governments."
ATM_air_desc: "While our lands aren't particularly blessed with strong winds, we are still far from utilizing the full potential of Zephyr's gifts. Even before the Fall, we were barely keeping pace with the global production leaders. In the many chaotic years since, nobody had either the resources or the will to develop even a single turbine while embroiled in near-constant warfare, but our increasingly stable and dominant position has allowed us to finally start drafting plans for the mass construction of wind power generators. Starting with the breezy coast, we'll create a network spanning as far as the eye can see - a field of giants, spinning graciously for the benefit of us all, towering over the landscape in an unceasing dance - proud symbols of our technological expertise and commitment to renewable energy production."
ATM_sun_desc: "Poland has always been a late adopter of the solar trend. When other nations were perfecting the technology's practical application, the use of panels was still in its infancy within our borders. Still, despite our slow start and harsh climate, we were on the right track to catch up, but our progress was interrupted by the Fall. After over a decade of turmoil, little remains of the vast seas of solar power collectors, most of which were destroyed in the fighting. Though the production and installation of countless panels are expected to put a noticeable dent in our yearly budget, we cannot rest until we complete the trifecta of renewable energy sources. We're on the cusp of achieving complete pollution-free energy independence, something thought to be a distant dream even during our country's better days. Let's prove the doubters wrong and make it a reality."
ATM_hydrogen_application_desc: "The wasteful times of relying on fossil fuels as our primary energy source are a thing of the past. We could drastically cut our emissions and combat plentiful health risks by turning to a new type of combustion - hydrogen power. While not nearly as effective as traditional fuel methods, utilizing the technology could greatly offset our carbon footprint and dispel any risks of a potential shortage. After all, it's quite hard to run out of the most abundant element in the entire universe. Though traditionally limited only to small engines in motor vehicles, with enough testing, we could expand its usage into nearly all industrial sectors, completely negating our previous dependence on coal. It would be a considerable, although negligible, sacrifice in productivity, but we can ensure smooth sailing and sustainability for years to come. In our situation, it's far better to have something reliable than risk a blackout like the one experienced by the Brotherhood."
ATM_co2_filters_desc: "Despite our progress, we still haven't been able to fully get rid of carbon, and likely won't be for a considerable amount of time. Certain industries simply don't have any applicable, environmentally-friendly alternatives to use as power sources, and completely shutting down crucial branches of our production is an untenable prospect. However, we don't have to sit idly as we are forced to emit harmful pollutants. Recent advances in technology have allowed the application of carbon dioxide filters, where ambient air is passed through an absorbent material that gathers CO2, which is then promptly condensed and turned into carbonate minerals. If sufficient efficiency of the process can be reached, we could reach net-zero emissions even in plants utilizing fossil fuels. Though it's only a temporary solution, it should be enough to serve us for many years to come."
ATM_achievements_of_reduction_plan_desc: "The reduction plan has been nothing short of controversial. Willingly slashing our production in such a trying time for a goal as abstract as combatting climate change surely didn't bring us any new allies. But even if it were to cause most of our former sympathizers to desert us, the success of the campaign can only be judged through one metric - whether it actually managed to lower our emissions. And to this end, we can, without any embellishment, refer to it as a success, albeit not a resounding one. We're on the correct path, and if we stick to it with as much dedication as thus far, we might actually have a shot at achieving environmental sustainability in the coming years. Thanks to our efforts, Poland is being reborn, and nature returns to reclaim its rightful lands, so violently stolen by our predecessors. We're doing the right thing. We just need to keep at it."
ATM_captain_planet_desc: "At the start of our atomic crusade, we inherited an environmental disaster unlike any seen before in the developed world. After over a decade of efforts to salvage what little remained of our fragile ecosystem and transition to renewable energy sources at breakneck speeds, we have managed to undo a century’s worth of damage and position ourselves as the leaders of a new, healthier age. Mother Nature is healing, and it’s all thanks to one man. Jakub Wiech has achieved the impossible, turning the tide in the global fight against climate change, and for the first time, instead of murmurs of doubt, the crowds cheer with enthusiasm at the sight of the visionary carrying them into the future. No longer the perpetual underdog, he has since come to be regarded for who he truly is - a hero; the planet’s greatest protector. As long as he stands, humanity’s destructive forces of greed shall never triumph."
ATM_black_eagle_desc: "Our western border is far from safe. One day, we could be celebrating our victories on the home front, the next we could lose it all in a renewed invasion. The Germans have already shown their willingness to interfere in our affairs, and their current rhetoric isn't any more friendly than it was all those years ago. Back then, they had their Union partners to stop them before they managed to fully subjugate us. This time, we won't be so lucky. The long-term goals of Energiewende are clear - the eradication of nuclear power worldwide. If they have the gall to bark at superpowers on the other side of the world, they aren't just gonna tolerate their eastern neighbor undergoing an atomic resurgence. Eventually, they're gonna strike. When they do, we'll teach them to stay on their own side of the Oder and never mess with Poland again."
ATM_fortify_border_desc: "Though natural obstacles give us some much-needed protection, the bridges on the Oder provide any would-be invader with a perfect opportunity to cross the mighty river. Once the Germans break into the vast open plains on its eastern side with their tank columns, there is little we can do to stop them from reaching our heartlands. Within minutes, we could find ourselves overrun and lose control of our best defense line. At that point, we might as well surrender. Once war breaks out, we can't expect to be given any time to prepare. We'll most likely face an immediate full-on assault. We must be ready so that at the first sight of enemy formations, we can blow up all the crossings, position our troops in their newly built fortifications along the river line, and shoot the Bundeswehr like sitting ducks as they try in vain to force their way through."
ATM_formation_of_minutemen_desc: "When our lines are inevitably breached, how much time will we have to plug the rapidly widening gap? An hour? A day? Definitely not long enough for our General Staff to gather and think of some miraculous plan to salvage the situation. Back in the day, we used to rely on our Territorial Defense Forces, however, their idea proved largely ineffective when faced with an actual threat. Under enemy fire, they crumbled, always late to the action, never enough to alter the battle's outcome. What we need is a unit that will be able to respond immediately, nullifying any danger at a moment's notice - requiring no longer than the proverbial minute to join the front lines. With the ability to reinforce seemingly at will, our lines will become unbreakable, and any hostile assault will grind itself down without achieving even a modicum of progress."
ATM_mine_the_coastline_desc: "We'd be foolish to think that in the increasingly likely event of war, we'd only face attacks across the length of the border. The way of conducting offensive operations is radically different than it was in the days of our forefathers, and we can expect nearly every avenue of breaking past our defenses to be exploited by our enemies. Amphibious assaults are always a lucrative prospect for securing coastal areas, and our shore is long and scarcely defended. We can't hope to match the German fleet in the Baltic Sea's frigid waters. In a pitched battle, we'd be repulsed with ease. Though securing naval supremacy is an impossible task, we can at least deny our opponents the ability to operate in the vicinity of our coast at will. To prevent the threat of possible landings, we'll cover the sea with a blanket of mines so thick, that not a single vessel will be able to swim through unscathed. If they want to invade us from the north, they'll pay a heavy price for their hubris."
ATM_lessons_from_fall_desc: "In terms of warding off against a German invasion, we already have a painful example of what not to do. The incompetence of Morawiecki's government turned what was supposed to be a grueling slog of a campaign into a cakewalk, stopped only by the increasing fears of Berlin's supremacy among its allies. If we are to face the full might of the Bundeswehr, we can't afford to let divisions and uncertain sympathies be our downfall. We need to make the message clear - we'd be defending against a hostile force, hellbent on subjugating every Pole under a system of foreign oppression. Additionally, as much as the military's politicization has helped us retain the average soldier's devotion to our cause, we have to transition to a more professional force - built not on the fickle personal loyalty to a political idea, but on the undying devotion to the Fatherland. In the face of German aggression, we will be united in our fight for the nation's survival."
ATM_approach_the_french_desc: "Even if we manage to hold off the initial push, we can seldom expect to keep the Germans at bay forever. Eventually, their industrial might will overwhelm us. For each bullet we lose, they can afford to fire ten, not to mention all the specialized equipment at their disposal. If we're to survive, we're gonna need allies. The French don't regard us with much love, but they'll jump at the chance to weaken their nemesis in a heartbeat. If they could send us some much-needed supplies, we should be able to mount a capable defense long enough for them to exert diplomatic pressure to stop the conflict. If we establish contact and show them our best side, they should be tempted to see us as a worthy ally. Our nations have always been naturally friendly, it's about time to revive our partnership."
ATM_dust_off_old_machines_desc: "In a time of war, we can hardly afford to be picky, especially when dealing with an enemy with more than double our production capability. Once it comes to blows, we're going to need every advantage we can get, and thus, even relying on the Brotherhood's old, questionable equipment models isn't out of the question. Luckily, our former opponents were gracious enough to leave us a hefty stockpile of unused test models which now slowly rust in warehouses scattered around the voivodeship, abandoned. Sometimes the difference between victory and defeat can be a single rudimentary machine that plugs a crucial gap. To maximize our chances, we'll carefully examine the state of all such pieces, establishing an inventory detailing what could potentially be given to our soldiers, and what is nothing more than a pile of useless junk. At least a good portion should still be serviceable, right?"
ATM_rad_eaters_desc: "Prior to the Fall, Polish special forces maintained a fearsome reputation, with groups such as GROM, Agat, and JWK regularly being regarded as some of the most effective combat teams across the entire continent, capable of competing with even the cream of the global crop. Regrettably, none of the organizations managed to survive the multiple trials and tribulations of the country's most turbulent period, but their legacy still remains, as do many of their former cadres. If we're to square up against the Germans in an open conflict, we'll likely need to heavily utilize elite formations to create advantages in the front's key locations. With the training infrastructure largely intact and a good portion of former commandos willing to serve as instructors, we are in a position to build up our own special forces unit, held to the same, if not even higher standard than before. Wherever the Rad-Eaters appear, they'll tip the scales of battle in our favor, no matter how difficult their task has to be."
ATM_hearts_and_minds_desc: "Fear. Despite our continued achievements, it cripples all further efforts to integrate nuclear energy into the public sphere. The uninformed masses tremble nervously at the mere mention of the expansion of our programs, quietly praying for our downfall in vain hopes of self-preservation. Poland, like no other nation, has been harmed by the Atom's destructive potential. Now even peaceful initiatives have come to be associated with the disasters in Bałuty and Chernobyl. We're at an impasse, forced to tone down our policies to avoid the people's ire. To break the stalemate, we have to soothe their fears, showing them what nuclear technology really is - a modern, safe solution to our nation's energetic woes. Dispelling decades of anti-atomic propaganda will be an enormous task, but if we can at least convince a sizeable portion of our population, we can expect things to be way easier going forward."
ATM_lead_by_example_desc: "We can't expect people to believe our claims of nuclear safety if we don't at least show our own trust in them. It's merely a formality, but we're long overdue for a little comeback tour of Bałuty. Even now, only the bravest of souls dare tread on this desolate land, adding to the mythos about the risk a single atomic discharge, whether accidental or not, can pose. Of course, we're fully aware the area is safe. We literally spent months hiding in the blast zone's immediate vicinity. Still, it won't hurt to revisit the territory, turning the trip into a full-on PR stunt. Televise our appearance, take a few soil samples, and run a bunch of tests to show there's no lasting radiation. If we ensure everyone's watching, we might be able to once and for all prove that even the worst nuclear tragedy we've witnessed pails in comparison with the everyday destruction of coal."
ATM_affirmation_campaign_desc: "We’ve always made efforts to soften the Atom’s tarnished image in the minds of our people but without a fully-fledged campaign, there isn’t much we can hope to establish, especially with the Bałuty tragedy still so freshly etched into the collective memory. Many fail to see the difference between harmless nuclear power and the destructive potential of atomic weaponry. If we are to calm down their fears, we need to make it known that the 'terrifying megastructure ominously looming over their homes' belongs firmly in the first category, and won’t, in fact, blow up, devastating half the country. To make the distinction painfully clear, we’ll distribute flyers, plaster cities with billboards, and arrange open meetings with experts in nuclear technology for anyone having doubts about the project’s safety. By the time we’re done, every citizen will know there is nothing to fear."
ATM_we_could_use_media_desc: "Having a friendly media apparatus diligently working to spread your ideals to the masses isn't necessarily a bad thing, even if the truth has to sometimes be bent to keep you in the positive light. In controlling the press, the Brotherhood had the right idea but ruined it through terrible execution. We don't need to make up outright lies and censor all other viewpoints to appear like the good guys. We know we're right; we just have to ensure everyone gets the message. If we employ sufficient favoritism so that friendly publications can always maintain an edge over their competitors, soon every citizen will be seeing our narrative, complete with all the knowledge necessary to wholeheartedly stand by it, before coming across a single word thrown by our detractors to debunk it. Afterward, nobody in their right mind would even consider doubting us."
ATM_rewrite_education_system_desc: "The effects of decades of politicized education and blatant misinformation by those entrusted to shape the minds of our youngest citizens are plain to see. We have raised a generation of arrogant halfwits, unable to hold a single independent thought, perfectly poised to resonate the lies they've been repeatedly bashed with. The alumni of the Brotherhood Education System are largely a lost cause, but we can prevent such a situation from happening in the future. School isn't meant to drill its students into one correct way of thinking, even if it's our teachings it could be spreading. We need a true platform for critical thought that encourages discussion, diligent fact-checking, and methodical research. Unlike our opponents, we don't need to tell our kids what to believe. As long as we give them the appropriate tools to seek out the truth, they'll realize it lies with us anyway."
ATM_reintroduction_of_studies_desc: "To manage our multiple specialized and cutting-edge projects we require a large quantity of highly trained personnel. Regrettably, to say we lack sufficient cadres would be a vast understatement, as the suspension of nearly all higher education and persecution of anyone whose knowledge could be deemed dangerous have led to Europe’s largest case of brain drain, with the majority of experts having left for greener pastures. Even if some could be enticed to return, we're left with a generational gap of unskilled labor. If we resume the operation of the various technical colleges within our territory, placing a heavy emphasis on nuclear research and engineering within their curriculums, we might eventually be able to fill up the majority of crucial posts with a new breed of promising, ambitious professionals, though it will likely take multiple years before we see a full return on our investment into their futures."
ATM_children_of_atom_desc: "Poland's youngest generation, born and raised under our protective custody, is a source of near-limitless potential, uncorrupted by the evil lies of past regimes and traumatic events that shaped our nation's present consciousness. If properly nurtured, they could be the key to a brighter future for us all, but in order to set them on the right path, we must utilize their formative years by instilling the proper values into their vulnerable minds. Starting with primary schools and kindergartens, teachers will extol the virtues of the Atom in a simple, comprehensible form that makes the use of nuclear energy for the country's betterment sound as natural and fundamental as basic addition. For those willing to go the extra mile, we'll prepare a range of extracurricular activities, clubs, and groups to join to further spread the cause. It's a far cry from the devotion demanded by the youth organizations once operated by our despised predecessors, but it's still an effective way to ensure the kids' undying loyalty under the guise of carefree fun."
ATM_knowledge_is_death_of_fear_desc: "We've done all we could, repeatedly showing our citizens the safety of nuclear energy. Many of them listened. Some of our fiercest enemies have since joined our ranks as ardent supporters of the atomic cause. But not everyone has been so receptive. Many within the older generations continue their staunch opposition to anything nuclear, still babbling about disasters they barely remember. It will take a while before the stories that now circle Poland as legends, told by elders as a cautionary tale against placing too much trust in the Atom's reliability, finally die out. The youths have learned to tout the glory of nuclear power, displaying devotion we haven't witnessed since our initial battle against Ziemkiewicz's forces. Soon, they will form the backbone of Polish society, and our cause will be entrenched in the hearts and minds of our population."
ATM_utilize_radiation_desc: "Our recent excavation efforts have given us access to the holy grail of all energy sources - uranium. All of the conventional methods we've worked with thus far pale in comparison with the potency of even a single chunk of this wondrous ore. It's no exaggeration to say we've unlocked the true potential we've always strived for. Of course, regrettably, uranium does have its downsides, and as much as we'd like to expand its usage, the inherent radioactivity does, in fact, pose a serious risk. We know well enough not to sacrifice our people at the altar of progress, but the benefits are simply too high to pass up. We hold the key to our victory. Now, we have to decide what matters more - the individual or the greater good."
ATM_deadly_but_safe_desc: "We're not senseless monsters. If we're to utilize radioactive materials, it will all be done with one rule in mind - the safety of our citizens comes first. It's a real shame we won't ever be able to harness the full power of fission, but we've witnessed firsthand what destruction the mindless chase to completely exploit a resource's potential can bring. They say power corrupts, but we refuse to be tempted. Besides, we're not missing out on much. There are plenty of ways to safely make use of uranium, and our engineers are already hard at work to conceptualize our first projects. We can dream about what could've been, but we've made the right choice. We've kept our hearts in the right place, and our people will be grateful. We won't regret this. We can't."
ATM_uranium_armor_desc: "Depleted uranium, acquired as a by-product of the manufacturing of its enriched counterpart for use as fuel in our nuclear reactor has a few interesting properties of its own. Thanks to containing a lesser degree of the most fissile isotope, the metallic form is notable for its extremely high density, allowing it to serve as the perfect plating material for our armored vehicles. If fitted onto tanks between the sheets of steel, we could potentially greatly improve their resilience, rendering them nearly impenetrable to most conventional anti-armor weaponry. Of course, encasing our soldiers in what is essentially a radioactive capsule is a major health concern, but exposure should be limited enough not to pose significant risks during a standard battlefield shift. If circumstance forces them to operate for lengthier periods of time at once... well, that's what field hospitals are for."
ATM_uranium_bullets_desc: "Just as our capabilities rise, so do those of our enemies. Our recent wars have shown that we no longer have a monopoly on armor. Rather than blast hostile tanks with hundreds of useless pellets, we can use depleted uranium from our nuclear power plant to produce state-of-the-art piercing shells. With a sharper core that prevents fracturing on impact and subsequent easy flammability, these vessels of destruction will lay waste to even the toughest of platings with a single salvo. Through the mass application of this technology in specialized anti-tank battalions, we'll be able to completely nullify our foes' ability to conduct armored warfare. If they even so dare as to deploy their machinery anywhere near the frontline, we'll be sure to locate, target, and promptly annihilate it until they eventually retreat in shame, on foot."
ATM_nuclear_jets_desc: "The idea of equipping aircraft with nuclear propulsion is an old one, dating back to the early days of the Cold War, yet the concept never reached past the experimental stage. Even if enough energy could be generated to power the vehicles mid-flight, the problem of insufficient radiation shielding has long eluded scientists and engineers alike. But, where they faced difficulty, we see an opportunity. Thanks to the rapid pace of technological advancement, we might be able to find a suitable balance between efficiency and personnel safety. If we were to successfully produce a combat-ready model, we would have an advantage not just over the remaining warlords, but over the global hegemons as well. They still believe us to be fighting with makeshift guns and baseball bats. Imagine the surprise in their eyes when we show off a design they deemed impossible to pull off."
ATM_nuclear_engines_desc: "Ever since the power of the Atom was first harnessed, naval and nuclear developments have always been intertwined. The massive, slow-moving marine behemoths serve as perfect vessels for nuclear propulsion to be applied thanks to their rather uniform power usage across the majority of a typical cruise. The isolation provided by the vastness of the sea carries the additional benefit that if anything were to truly go wrong, any system failure would be a purely localized incident, without the risk of damage to the integrity of the remainder of the fleet. Though traditional applications are mostly contained to submarine models, the Polish Navy's near-complete destruction during the Invasion affords us the unique possibility to rebuild it from scratch, with the usage of atomic energy to power our ships as the standard set across the board. Starting with small cruisers and destroyers, we will build the world's largest nuclear fleet, perhaps one day fielding the first carrier to ever sail the Baltic Sea."
ATM_sacred_losses_desc: "Health concerns are an important factor, but in our current situation, we can't afford to prioritize the safety of a select few over the interests of everyone else. With dangers lurking around every corner, it would be insane to limit our potential over some humanitarian outcry. Of course, it's immoral to condemn a portion of our soldiers to a horrible, painful death as a result of radiation sickness. That's why they're heroes for so bravely volunteering to carry out such missions. If they hadn't, we'd all likely be dead, subjugated by a stronger force that does not hold back to ponder the righteousness of its actions. If we're to reach the lofty heights demanded by our ambitions, we'll need to harness the full power of the Atom, that is clear as day. We're making the mother of all omelettes. We can't fret over every egg."
ATM_precise_dispersion_desc: "Our critics love to claim we're oblivious to the dangers of radiation. Far from it. Yet unlike their limited, fearful minds, we see it as a potential waiting to be utilized, not avoided. If we were to strategically place radioactive materials near enemy formations, or perhaps within our own positions before conducting a tactical retreat, we could expect the particles fired off from the decaying nuclei to slowly cripple hostile armies without the need to fire a single bullet. As if struck by an unknown plague hanging over the battlefield, our rivals will drop like flies, leaving us to pick off all the remnants. Some more critical voices might label this plan as a supposed 'war crime,' but is it really any different than killing them the old-fashioned way? If anything, we're leaving those combatants with a unique chance to survive our assaults, if they manage to recover from the horrors of radiation sickness, of course."
ATM_attack_of_dead_men_desc: "Terraforming the battlefield into an irradiated, inhospitable wasteland that no human can survive in doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing. If we force the enemy to abandon, or at least weaken their positions to avoid the harmful effects of radiation that decimates their soldiers, we would find ourselves in the perfect position to conduct a devastating attack through the thinned-out lines, creating a powerful spearhead that could break any defense apart All we have to do is equip our soldiers with enough protective gear to survive the conditions long enough to complete their objectives. Their fate will likely be sealed, but it's better to condemn hundreds than to potentially lose tens of thousands in ineffective, conventional attacks. There is no greater honor than to die amongst the Atom's power, witnessing the force of radiation firsthand. If anything, the chosen should consider themselves lucky. They gave their lives for a good cause."
ATM_zeppelin_in_atomic_age_desc: "Ever since the Hindenburg tragedy over a hundred years ago, Zeppelins have been considered an unsafe, antiquated mode of travel. It's an incredibly close-minded way of thinking, especially since airships require far less power, both during takeoff, as well as on cruising altitude - making them the perfect vessel for nuclear compulsion to be applied. Another advantage is clear - the ability to spend multiple hours, potentially even days on continuous patrol, like an all-seeing watchman guarding us from the skies. And, if equipped with appropriate weaponry and somehow snuck into enemy territory, our Zeppelins could wreak havoc far behind their lines, striking at the industrial centers beyond the reach of conventional weaponry. By repurposing old Brotherhood projects and refitting them with the appropriate power source, we could immediately begin production, largely bypassing the planning stage. All the pieces are in place. We just need to set everything into motion."
ATM_modernization_of_mi14pl_desc: "During the Cold War, many of the foremost powers experimented with helicopters that could carry a nuclear payload. Able to operate with far greater flexibility than traditional aircraft, especially useful when battling against moving targets and conducting functions at lower altitudes. The Soviet sphere frequently utilized these machines, but the design has since become largely antiquated, relying on technologies patented over half a century ago. The core design is solid, potentially granting us the ability to enhance our air-to-ground nuclear capabilities, although it requires heavy improvements to bring it up to date with the requirements of modern warfare. If we could get our hands on the appropriate design specifications, we should be able to retrofit the models with our newest advancements. At that point, the helicopters should be able to stand up to even the most effective air defense systems."
ATM_threat_of_the_future_desc: "When we first started our struggle, our army consisted of nothing more than a bunch of glorified partisans. In the many years since, we've successfully transformed it into perhaps the most dedicated fighting force in all of Europe, armed to the teeth with a plethora of groundbreaking technologies. But, above all, we're no longer just chasing global trends. Our ubiquitous use of nuclear energy across all branches of our armed forces places us at the forefront of a coming revolution that will forever redefine the art of war, launching it squarely into the atomic age. Through our achievements, we have redefined the world's polarity, disturbing the hegemony of the current superpowers. They despise our drive, accusing us of playing with fire at everyone's expense, but mostly, they fear being left behind. We are the first to make this forward leap, but we won't be the only ones. Yet, as they attempt to catch up to us, we'll always be ten steps ahead, forever the pioneers of nuclear weaponry."
ATM_medical_usage_desc: "The lingering smog is a slow but methodical killer. Its continued presence has given rise to all kinds of illnesses, chief among them cancers. Given the current state of our overburdened healthcare system, such a diagnosis has thus far nearly always been a death sentence. No longer. Our society is ailing, and we have the cure. Radioisotope treatment has long been regarded as one of the greatest breakthroughs in the field of oncology, but the cost and difficulty of procuring suitable therapeutics have been deemed far too large for us to invest. Now that we have access to some... less-proven isotopes, we can finally bring the idea to life. While a number of doctors have raised concerns over the safety and potential side effects of using highly radioactive materials on patients without first conducting appropriate clinical trials, the benefits largely outweigh all potential risks. After all, it's all the same process anyway. What's the worst that can happen?"
ATM_agricultural_usage_desc: "Polish agriculture is yet to fully recover from the damage dealt by the Brotherhood during its short reign over Łódzkie. In our efforts to continue its revitalization, we have just acquired a powerful, albeit unexpected nuclear ally. The radiation emitted by the decay of unstable elements provides radiographic potential to determine the best placement and application of fertilizers, and, due to its harmful effects on animals, allows an unmatched degree of pest control that could replace the usage of pesticides. Besides, just as the nearly inhospitable conditions and earth pollution accelerated the natural selection of the most resilient plant strains, so too can radiation be used to induce mutations that might help us breed higher-yield variants. For once, the science here is foolproof, tested over multiple continents and soil types. The conclusion is clear - our agricultural woes are about to be overcome."
ATM_industrial_usage_desc: "Uranium's potential applications within various sectors of industry are largely marginal, and thus oft overlooked, but we always remain open to new solutions utilizing nuclear materials. Besides usage for R&D purposes,   we stand poised to develop the field of industrial radiography, allowing for the precise imaging of internal features of metals and welds used in our infrastructure, especially the frequently shoddy parts constructed by vanquished warlords, to check for any potential structural defects. Additionally, the unstable molecules can also be used for the sterilization of food and hospital supplies, as well as the function of gauging devices that precisely control the density and thickness of used materials. All of these uses are minor and mostly situational, but they quickly add up, allowing us to stand at the forefront of industrial innovation. No longer will Poland be the technological backwater of Europe. From now on, we set the global standards."
ATM_last_son_of_atom_desc: "We've achieved much for our nation, defying expectations at nearly every step to transform it from a war-torn wasteland into an up-and-coming superpower. The country has been reborn, placed under competent leadership for perhaps the first time in its long, storied history. The lush green fields of Western Poland, the scenic coastlines of Pomerania, the untamed mountains of the Tatra highlands - sights thought forever lost to time have been reclaimed, harmoniously blended with a sustainable nuclear industry that will serve as the nation's unshakeable backbone for centuries to come. We stand at the cusp of victory, yet one enemy remains in our path, increasingly envious of our rising strength and international standing. From their seat of power in Berlin, the Germans look upon us with flaming wrath as the antithesis of their anti-nuclear rhetoric, the exemplification of all their misguided shortcomings. Whether we like it or not, we'll have to curb their imperial dreams."
ATM_winter_is_coming_desc: "The German menace won't give in lightly. They keep testing us, methodically increasing the tensions on the border and prodding at our weaknesses to get us to break. They've made their position clear - conflict is unavoidable, and they are preparing for the final showdown to settle our grudges once and for all. There can be no negotiating with Berlin. They know that if they don't defeat us now, they'll likely never get another opportunity to prevent us from eclipsing their once-formidable might. Every day, more soldiers line up on the Oder's shores, awaiting the fateful command to strike. Soon, the waters will run red with the blood of the fallen, but we are not without a choice in the matter. We can either take a waiting stance, preserving our strength in preparation for the inevitable attack, or conduct a decisive strike that might render them helpless before they even manage to figure out a response. Our decision could alter the fate of our entire nation."
ATM_nuclear_winter_desc: "The last few decades have turned Germany into an unreconcilable climate terrorist, utterly convinced of the righteousness of their anti-atomic Energiewende policy. They wish to impose their will upon the world, starting with their rebellious neighbor - Poland. Those who try colonialism once, often develop a taste for it, and the bureaucrats in Berlin are quite the connoisseurs. Since they had us in their grasp once, it's much harder to let go now. We can keep groveling like their little puppets, or we can finally assert our independence. Waiting passively will do us no good. If we're to truly show our resolve, we'll need to be proactive. The Germans will never learn not to tread on us unless we give them a taste of their own medicine. Luckily, we have the perfect surprise just for this occasion."
ATM_western_crusade_desc: "The Germans listen only to arguments of strength. They think they can bully us, but this time, we'll fight back. To once and for all crush the Black Eagle's imperialistic ambitions, we'll have to clip its wings so that it may never fly again. Together with our French allies, we have no choice but to conduct a two-pronged offensive, striking Germania from both the East and West. We will attack first, pushing past the Oder all the way to the Elbe, while French columns advance to reach the Rhine. Coupled with our little 'gift,' that should be more than enough to completely collapse the hostile government, forever freeing us, and Europe, from Berlin's tyranny. On the ashes, we'll rebuild the continent anew, stronger than ever, placed firmly under our rightful leadership. The end of an era approaches."
ATM_what_berlin_desc: "The day of reckoning has come. We can no longer tolerate Germany's impunity. Even when faced with the inevitability of our triumph, they refuse to yield by a single inch. They resent us. They think we don’t have the guts. They'd rather let their whole country burn just so they don't have to live to see themselves overshadowed by a strong, united Poland. If that is what they want, so be it. We'll cut the snake's head off before the Germans even realize what happened. In the dark of night, we'll sneak a team of our most loyal soldiers deep into enemy territory. Their mission will be simple. Reach Berlin with their payload, and once in the vicinity of a convened Bundestag, detonate the warhead and promptly end all German leadership. We wanted peace, but for it to be achieved, Berlin must be cleansed with nuclear fire."
ATM_and_we_are_ready_desc: "The line between righteous self-defense and condemnable offensive actions is thin, but even when repeatedly provoked, we refuse to cross it. The Germans are testing us. They want us to attack and confirm the international community's unwarranted fears about our movement. By no means will we ever willingly fall into their trap. They know they're losing. They're acting out of desperation. With each passing day, we're only getting stronger while Enegiewende wriggles in its dying throes. Soon, they'll be in no position to challenge us, reduced to a sad little rump state, for which their former hegemonic ambitions will be nothing more than nostalgia. The polarity of the world is changing, and we're emerging as the planet's primary environmental guardians, the heralds of a new, sustainable era. All we have to do is weather this final storm."
ATM_watchers_on_the_oder_desc: "Confrontation is unavoidable, but we'll make sure it happens on our terms only. Our western neighbors are itching for a fight, but we'll force them into submission without even firing a single bullet. Since they can't behave, together with our allies in the European Community, we'll enforce a complete embargo on all German products, essentially cutting them off from the world at large. Nevertheless, we must be ready for war. Our eternal enemy won't let itself be starved out without a fight, and so we need to mobilize the whole nation and increase combat readiness along our western flank in preparation for the onslaught to come. We'll protect the Oder with all our might so that no German may slip through to our lands. Berlin shall learn the meaning of hunger until they finally come crawling to the negotiating table, begging for us to relieve them."
ATM_call_berlin_desc: "We've softened them up enough, now is the time to make the Germans pay. Our list of demands is long, a reflection of the plentiful grudges we hold for the decades of meddling in our sovereignty. One could say it's almost impossible to meet our ultimatum without permanently compromising Berlin's international standing and economy. That is precisely the goal - cripple them thoroughly enough so that they may never threaten us again. The Chancellor can kick and scream about the harshness of our requests, but if he has any sense of self-preservation left, he'll accept them anyway. His nation is alone, suffering in its isolation, crying out for relief at all costs. Of course, once his countrymen learn of the burden about to befall them for their government's actions, chaos will ensue on the streets of Germania. That, however, is not our problem. For us, that is merely the sight of triumph."

Can you be surprised that I agreed to join them?\nNow, I'm one of the Atomic Crusaders, waiting to avenge my father, readying my weapon. And I'm scared as hell. I've waited so long for this chance, I can't chicken out now. I was never allowed to train with the real weapons. The ammo was to scare new recruits and the gunshots would gather unwanted attention. I was mostly relegated to smuggling the provisions, following Paladins' patrols, and spraying anti-Brotherhood graffiti. I was never prepared to storm the Downtown Police Department. On the bright side, the Brotherhood's spread thin and they can't fill all the garrison positions with enough men.

Do you plead guilty?\n - What a farce. - Ziemkiewicz thought - Wife of a laughable Korwinist as the advocate and a disgraced lawyer as the prosecutor. This was the last time the world could hear the Brootherhood's truth.\n - Humanity? - he began - I tried to save it! Have you not seen that there is no future in the Atom?

atom_reg.3.desc: "The reckoning of the old Brotherhood began and every member who held any significance within it, was put to trial. The head of the snake, Ziemkiewicz, was cut off. However, the biggest pest was still at large and if you don’t remove cancerous cells, they may cause metastasis.\n\nOnce it was obvious that the fall of Bełchatów was imminent, Łukasz Warzecha saw the writing on the wall and decided to do what was best for him. As the Crusade was approaching, he quickly left Bełchatów and with only a few vital items by his side, he hid in the nearby village of Huta. Many days have since passed and the fighting has long gone silent. “Ziemkiewicz surrendered” he thought, although he still saw flags he pledged loyalty to waving on the Fire Station. “Has Ziemkiewicz done the impossible?”, “But defeat seemed so imminent”. He knew one thing - had Ziemkiewicz survived, the Palladin must redeem himself for betraying his leader so quickly.\n\nIn order to do that, he traveled to the Broadcasting Station of Piotrków, capturing some lost enviromentalist on the way. The building was empty, but the power was remained on, presenting Warzecha with a great opportunity. He quickly placed the hostage on the stage. Lights, cameras, action. He could seldom utter a single word, before the rusted doors were sprung open and Warzecha found himself surrounded by a Unit of Crusaders. Unbeknownst to him, Łukasz Warzecha has just willingly entered the lion’s lair.\n\nHe was taken to the closest court, with a cameraman in front of him during the whole journey, where Jakub Wiech, the Atomic Crusader himself, was waiting for the Palladin’s trial. The people were seated and the judge entered the room. Charges against Warzecha didn’t seem to end. Suddenly, the accused stood up, looked Wiech in the eyes and shouted “Out with the Atom, Long Live the Black Gold!”. After that he bit through something and… collapsed on the desk."

There is still opposition among the populace, especially in the region around Bełchatów, where the indoctrination was deeply rooted. Many members who were deemed too unimportant to be either tried or sentenced, formed a sort of opposition to Wiech’s rule. Forming many organizations on the verge of legality and organizing cells all around the former Łódź Voivodeship, they did whatever they could to turn the populace against atom.\n\nAt the same time, Jakub Wiech tried to organize actions to promote his agenda, which mostly entailed the liberalization of many leftover, nonsensical policies. One such policy was about “green cuisine”, which tried to encourage people to eat more healthily. It's no surprise the remnants of the Brotherhood went on a campaign against eating any greens, trying to portray vegetables as weak and leftist. But the most important program was Wiech’s campaign on coal - that which the Brotherhood regarded as a sacred treasure. Obviously, any slander against it was out of the question in the deeply brainwashed society. One wrong word and the people would voice their discontent on the streets. \n\nFor now, the opposition decided to settle for an occasional feisty exchange of words in the press or flyers and rational (in their outlook) argumentation - reduction of coal usage may mean reduction of production, especially when it’s too hastily done."

I served under them, cause they took me from the streets, gave me some rusted carbine and sent me to the front. Always hated those self-righteous bastards for what they did to my Bełchatów.\n Staszek seemed alright and genuinely thankful for my rescue, but Mrożek didn't feel it was time to reveal it wasn't the first time he killed a Brotherhood member. The first was when the Atomic Crusaders cornered him and his squad in one of Bełchatów houses. Their commander, a god-damned fanatic, was adamant about holding this hopeless position. When Mrożek got his chance, he shot the commander and surrendered to the approaching Wiechovites. His squadmates had no other choice, but to surrender as well. He saved five lives that day by his own account. Five lives of brain-washed drones, who considered him a traitor for what he's done. Who knew, maybe some of them would put a knife between his ribs if he stayed in Bełchatów. Haunted by that thought, he moved to Kutno and became one of the Crusaders there."

atom_reg.8.desc: "Gadomski kept his head low for the whole duration of the proceedings, torn between his loyalties to the Brotherhood and common sense. The irony! Common sense has been what started the Brotherhood. It was a vastly different organization at the beginning. Or maybe it was something he told himself to find any justification. No, of that he was sure. The Brotherhood was a movement of caution. Caution about rapid decarbonization, about nuclear energy, about foreign influences! If only it wasn't for those zealots constricting his efforts. Yes! That's how it was!\nThat is why he betrayed them.\n\nWhen he was asked about his involvement in the Brotherhood, Gadomski shared his thoughts about the carbon fanatics and appeared to truly show remorse. He also admitted he'd been sending intel, including a copy of Warzecha's compromising report, to the Atomic Crusaders in the last months of the Brotherhood's existence. His lawyer promptly provided the material evidence corroborating his words. Wiech was called as a witness for even more credibility.\n Gadomski was glad no other member of the council was there with him. He knew he'd done the right thing, but still, the thought of seeing his former colleagues... former Brothers, made him feel uneasy./n/n - Witold Gadomski, the court has found you guilty. There are, however, many mitigating circumstances in your case. - Judge Wesołowska exclaimed - To ensure you won't try to spread seditious carbonist agenda, the court sentences you to a year in a re-education camp. Take the accused away.\n - Not bad - Gadomski thought to himself as was being escorted out of the courtroom - Given other circumstances, he could've been sentenced to 20 years.\n\n - Quite unexpectedly, one of the guards whispered to him.\n\nLater that day, when Gadomski was languishing in his arrest cell, waiting for the transport, he was visited by Wiech himself. The ecologist presented him with a mysterious offer; one so outlandish, Gadomski thought it was some kind of joke.\n\n - Would you be interested in shortening your sentence to three months, Witold?"

Besides the desk, a chair, and a bed, the cell was also outfitted with a large bookshelf, a filing cabinet, a computer, and a printer.\n - Thank you. You can leave us now - Wiech instructed the guard.\n - Great Ecologist? Really? - Gadomski asked mockingly. - Are you some kind of religious leader?\n - The people you tormented needed someone to believe in. The harsh reality is you helped create a bedrock for such fervor. And that is why I hope you're willing to atone.\nInstead of responding, Gadomski turned in his chair to face Wiech and handed him his freshly finished report. Wiech read Gadomski's work briefly, deeply pondering the provided bullet points.\n - Impressive what one can accomplish in three months. - Wiech applauded the minister's efforts.\n - Truth be told, I've been thinking about some of those things back when I was still in office. - Gadomski admitted in his humility.\n - But I'm anxious about the lack of details and the rampant privatization that will ensue once we implement your plan.\n - Firstly, I don't remember all the ins and outs of the Brotherhood's economy. Secondly, if I showed you all I know, you wouldn't need me anymore. - Gadomski smirked, trying to gain as much of an upper hand as he could in his disadvantaged position - And privatization is needed as well. Many industrial plants are extremely uneconomic. Not to mention detrimental to your sacred environment. And the Brotherhood's budget is worryingly unbalanced. It's also a fact that the Atomic Crusade is more akin to the People's Crusade than the Third Crusade when it comes to the amount of wealth it has at its disposal. We need local entrepreneurs and a bunch of foolishly brave foreign investors. And someone knowledgeable enough to know which assets should be sold and which should be kept during the transitional period.\nEver so sly, Gadomski smiled again, giving the Great Ecologist a meaningful glance.\n\nWiech wished to give the plan one last thought before he was to make a deal with the devil, but he realized he really didn't have any other choice. Thus, he reached out for a handshake.\n - Welcome to the government, Gadomski."

Anxiety filling his mind.\n - I hope he's not angry at me he's not the first one to open them.

He even gathered evidence against himself, making the list of his crimes even longer than any of the Crusaders have thought.\n - It's a shame, we've already sentenced the bastard.\nThere were also details about the opposition members who went MIA. A lot of them were executed as expected, but some of them were imprisoned in secret underground jails. Jails the Crusaders knew nothing about.\n - We can still save those people.\nLastly, Wiech turned his eyes to the dreaded chapter containing the information about the hooks and spies in the Atomic Crusade.\nNeither Byzdra nor Czyżewski were mentioned there.\n - Thank God. - No catalogue of files, no matter how big, could describe the relief Wiech felt at that moment.\nTurns out the Crusade was keeping its secrets.

The guards seemed agitated and their number decreased every day. The braver among us tried to ask what was going on and were beaten to a pulp for it. None of us expected that one they they would just leave.\n\nTheir departure didn't mean our torment would end, however. The Brotherhood left in a great hurry, you could tell they were terrified. 'They're even closer than we thought'; 'We don't have much time'; 'Evacuate all the personnel'. Some tried to escape with them and they were gunned down without mercy. Then most of us backed down. That gave them time to set up the explosives and detonate them near the entrance, sealing us inside.\n\n From that time days passed in the dim electric light. All we've got were the spare rations the guards left in haste. We got water from the cave walls. We were sleeping and waking up with no idea if there was day or night. Most of us decided to finally rest and gave up mining since no one was watching us anymore. Few, those who were here the longest, kept on mining fearing that the Brotherhood would return to punish them if they slacked. Most of us ridiculed them, at least initially. But as we stayed underground paranoia, anxiety, and hate against Brotherhood grew. Some said they heard paladins marching in the deeper corridors of the mines. People down here were on the verge of savagery, contmplating eating the dead.\nSo when we heard a gigantic machine outside, probably another of their crazy war machines. When the boulders blocking the entrance were slowly being removed, we deduced the Brotherhood came back after their sudden disappearance to get us back to work. 'No chance I get back to mining after all this' one of us said. We were blinded by light as the passage was clear, but we could see soldiers with flashlights coming down to us. With little thought, we threw stones at them and charged at them with pickaxes with our hands. One was one of the very first attackers. We were being shot at.

Fear of Chernobyl and what it did to the surroundings and inhabitants of Pripyat overwhelmed populace in the 80’s and 90’s, which caused the termination of Żarnowiec Power Plant project. This disaster taught the current populace of what harm may Atom do to one’s body, but also how human error may cause such a tragedy.\n\nOne of more recent disasters was one in Fukushima, a reactor suffering a meltdown due to tsunami. This caused more distrust for Atom, and taught  the populace of how nature may affect it.\n\nAnd last came the Bałuty explosion, a finale of European intevention in Poland. Many people lost their lives, their homes, their families and what remained of old Bałuty district is nothing but a pile of rubble and pain.

He could swear the old Boeing was about a minute away from crumbling to pieces, and that single thought did more to keep him awake than the uncomfortable headrest and the chair in front of him constantly crushing his knees. The entire journey, he desired nothing except to throw himself onto the nearest bed and sleep off his nightmarish travel. But when the Polish envoy finally set foot on the poorly kept runway and saw an entire delegation chanting his name, he thought he was already dreaming. \n\nThe red carpet, a marching band triumphantly blaring the hymn of the host nation, a slew of praise from a man styling himself as the minister of Mines and Energy - all of that only helped exacerbate the sleepless diplomat's headache. He quickly popped two pills of Ibuprofen, before being reluctantly dragged into a government vehicle along with the entourage. The next three hours had been a blur. Instead of the expected short tour around the capital, the drive continued, piercing the surrounding savanna in some unknown direction. Courtesy demanded Artur actually spend the time conversing with the official doubling as the local guide, but, in his haze, the best he could do was limit himself to memorized propaganda phrases. \nWhen the Rössing mine appeared suddenly before his eyes in all its glory, Artur was sure he'd crossed the border between reality and hallucinations. It was larger than anything he'd seen before, dwarfing even the might of the open pits of Bełchatów. Following a brief walk around the excavation area under the full force of the desert sun, clearly meant to impress the ambassador more than anything, the group headed to an unassuming shack serving as the complex's operational center. \nBelieving he had sufficiently softened up the envoy, the minister went on the offensive, probing the staggering diplomat for any possible concessions. \n-You know, Mr. Zawadzki, the Namibian government would gladly work with your nation, but I'm sure you're aware of the situation up north. If the rebels push any further, they could cut our export routes. We need you just as much as you need us. \n-Oh... well, why don't you just... push them back? - Artur replied in his dreamlike state, only partly registering the words said to him. \n-We'd love to do that, but we don't have nearly enough guns to break the stalemate. Our last offensive has already put us on the back foot. \n-Guns... we've got some guns... we can share... \n-Thank you, Mr. Zawadzki, that would mean the world to us. I'll go get the papers ready. \n\nIt took no more than five minutes of hurried scribbling for the delegation to return with the finished agreement. The document was chock-full of errors, something a distinguished diplomat like himself should have immediately noticed, yet as Artur pretended to read the numerous terms and stipulations about covert weapon shipments, all he could focus his eyes upon was the signature box. Going through the text of the treaty in record time, he inscribed his name on the bottom, officially bringing it to life.

Nobody would bother visiting the area unless they had a specific purpose, and so a place such as this was largely left to its own devices. \n\nWith any unknown traffic consisting of beaters driven by lost wanderers, Marcin could hardly contain his confusion at the sudden sight of a pristine black sedan. The model was unlike anything he'd ever seen before - a marvel of engineering that the war-torn country simply couldn't produce. It had to belong to someone important. He closely followed the car during its entire drive through the village, wondering if it was a sign of better things to come. He chalked it up as a fluke, but he soon found himself wishing he'd chased it out when he had the chance. \n\nLife in Central Podlaskie had a certain rhythm, like a meandering river with its course set over hundreds of years of undisturbed isolation. Yet, in the tiny hamlet of Rajsk, the flow had encountered a rock that turned it into a turbulent stream. Though Marcin knew it not, his home stood at the crossroads of history, and he was to be one of the victims of progress. \n\nLess than a week after the first sighting, the car returned. A short, spectacled man emerged from it, ignoring all questions, drawing a detailed map of the village, scribbling some unknown remarks, and filling out heaps of documents. The next day, a construction crew showed up, coupled with an armed escort. A massive bulldozer entered Marcin's property, readying itself to deliver a blow that would destroy the villager's livelihood. He rushed out of his home just in time to watch it collapse as soon as the wrecking ball made contact, screaming and shouting at the official until his lungs gave out. \n\nThe assurances of a new, state-provided home made no difference, neither did the hefty sum of money offered as compensation for this wanton use of eminent domain. Every word said by the official served only to further enrage Marcin, and after a brief moment, the spat quickly turned to blows. A splatter of red stained the bureaucrat's perfectly ironed flannel - the last sight of victory the villager saw before a peacekeeper's baton put him to sleep."

atom_supreg.1.desc: "The first phase of cleaning up the post-Brotherhood mess was over. Jakub Wiech sat in his bunker in Bałuty, contemplating the Crusade's situation. He just won the war against the man who tried to erase him, erasing him instead. There were still many problems that were yet to come, however. As one chapter ended, another began. \n\nHe glanced at the map of the lands the Crusaders managed to conquer, trying to discuss the matters at hand with his own thoughts. \n“...can we still manage to conquer all of the country? Is there even any place for discussion with people?” - his inner dialogue immedeatly shifted to half-conscious muttering to himself, as if he drank himself to stupor with his thoughts - “Hołownia tried this approach...-seems to have ended up in mud...” \nZiemkiewicz clearly had an easier job managing people under his belt than him. By legalising Greenpeace, he just created another problem. Conversion of power plants was another one, then there was Germany, starting the uranium trade and extraction operations. All these problems were piling up in Wiech’s head.\n\nHis eyes turned towards the small stack of reports on his desk. \n“What do we have here...ah yes, ...-report on Greenpeace's activity. Or bullshit, rather...fucking rabble bites the hand that feeds them, the fuckers...can’t they just be thankful for a minute?”. \nAnother report, this time on Brotherhood activity in the Łódź Voivodeship. \n“...shit's like cancer. Let one cell run away and it’s back again all over the whole body. ...let’s hope it won’t spread outside ...” \n\nThe ominous message from Berlin was still on his mind. It was unreal for him to be compared to radical terrorists, like Bin Laden. He knew that unification of Poland means eventual confrontation with Germany. \n“...they're just dumbasses scared of atomic power. Panicking old hags. Chernobyl still lives in their head.” \nHe took a pause there, his thought process suddenly sobering up. “...Is it really worth it? All this... I just wanted to stop Ziemkiewicz and now I am on my way to unify the entire country. Was this really our goal?”. As his mind started to be filled with dark clouds, he saw a file, piled under all reports he got. Inside there was a report on quality of air, on standards of living, on the environment. - Their work was for the better for all. Why should they stop? Right this second, Jakub stood up, took a sip of his black coffee and went straight into action."

Dyrektor ds. geologicznych z Narodowej Agencji Klimatycznej, Andrzej Maciejewski wracał ze spotkania w sprawie badań kolejnych potencjalnych miejsc, gdzie w przyszłości można byłoby zbudować elektrownie atomowe. Szofer zatrzymał się na skraju jezdni zaraz za znakiem ostrzegającym o dzikich zwierzętach. Jako, że byli w środku lasu, równie dobrze na jezdni mógł się znajdować rozjechany jeleń. Ale serce podskoczyło dyrektorowi do gardła gdy ujrzał, że to co zauważył było ciałem człowieka. \n- Kurwa...Marek dzwoń na policję! - rzucił do swojego kierowcy. Ten natychmiast wyciągnął telefon i gorączkowo próbował się dowiedzieć gdzie się tak naprawdę się znajdują. Nawigacja wskazywała drogę wojewódzką 726, a pobliski słupek kilometrowy uświadczył go w przekonaniu że są pośrodku niczego. Zanim jednak zdążył wykręcić numer alarmowy, usłyszał przeraźliwy krzyk, jak gdyby dzika obdzierano ze skóry.\n- AAAAAAAAAAAA JA PIERDOLĘ - był to dyrektor, który podszedł bliżej ciała wiedziony zwykłą ciekawością. - ON NIE MA PŁUC, WYCIĘLI MU JEBANE PŁUCA!\n\nMaciejewski jako jeden z nielicznych przetrwał cały Upadek bez traumatycznych wspomnień, i nie był przystosowany psychicznie do widoku krwi i juchy. A tym bardziej zmasakrowanych trupów ludzi z wnętrznościami dookoła. To wszystko sprawiło że natychmiastowy refluks żołądkowy ujrzał światło dzienne szybciej niż mózg dyrektora zdążył zareagować paniką. Wymioty rzuciły go na kolana, jednakże po chwili zorientował się że coś mu nie pasuje w tym makabrycznym krajobrazie. \n- M...M...Marek! Tu jest coś napisane...- wnętrzności ofiary układały się w odrażający napis "MORDERCY" - Chodź tu szybko! To jest kurwa jakiś kult chy...- odwracając się, \n\nW pół kroku stanął wryty niczym słup soli. Jego kierowca właśnie podzielił los poprzedniego denata. Nad jego ciałem stał mężczyzna w ciemnozielonym stroju z równie zieloną kominiarką na twarzy. W normalnej sytuacji Maciejewski by się roześmiał, ale widząc ostrze ociekające krwią które tamten dzierżył w dłoni nie było mu wcale do śmiechu. Dyrektor pomyślał że skoro jest tylko jeden to może uciec. Nie zauważył jednak drugiego zamachowca który chwycił go od tyłu w żelaznym uścisku.\n- W imieniu wolnej Ziemi skazuję Cię na śmierć za zbrodnie przeciwko planecie, dyrektorze. \n\nI nastał koniec. Światłość przeistoczyła się w ciemność, a dookoła zieleń przeistoczyła się w czerwień. "

Connected to a network of cameras, the car was stationed in the town's main square, currently occupied by protesters bearing fancy suits and symbols of both the pre-Fall Konfederacja party and the Brotherhood - all of 'em shouting, cursing, and setting trash cans on fire to ridicule the atomic cause. Most had ties to the coal state's apparatus and were very young - too young to remember what the air quality was before. And they were *angry*. \n\nDespite the local coal power plant, steelworks, and charcoal retort kilns being kept alive to maintain the local social and economic structures in a somewhat intact state, the entire powiat saw such a decline in wealth that many ex-industrial workers had to abandon their homes and return to living in self-made roadside shacks. \n\nThe protesters, meanwhile, were busy blindly parroting their economists' graphs and worsening the air quality even further: many came with Wiechovite propaganda posters to burn during the demonstrations, only adding to the reduced visibility. In fact, the duo in the car had almost no vision of what was happening outside their 'Wagen,' most of the cameras showing only what vaguely looked like a black cloud sinking in the all-encompassing grayness. \n\n- Yo, look. - Bartek detected some movement amongst the fires  - Something's happening. \n- Oh shit.

Two clouds of people connected with each other, one quickly getting considerably smaller and smaller. \n- COMMAND! THE GUARDS OPENED FIRE! - shouted Kajtek \n- COMMAND! COMMAND! THEY'RE CHARGING US! CHARGING US! \nAs one of the groups dissipated in the fog, the duo braced themselves, opened up the car doors, and let their guns loose, whatever was in front of them be damned.

atom_supreg.6.desc: "If any country wishes to exist, it must have four things: citizens, government, territory and international relations. Without just one of them, it cannot be considered a country. Jakub Wiech perfectly knows that, just as any Polish warlord who wishes to reunify Poland. While any statelet in the ruins of once a great country, can guarantee the first three, the matter of the last one can be granted to only one, as there can be only one Poland. Jakub knew he must act fast. Conveniently, Sweden is soon supposed to host the UN Summit about Climate Change and Enviromental Problems. The Crusader decided to use this opportunity and attend it, while representing Poland and trying to gain international recognition for his Atomic Crusade.\n\nEach delegation gathered in Stockholm, among them delegation from Atomic Crusade with Jakub Wiech in person. He entered the hall and sat on the seat that was empty for years, which caused a wave of wonder amongs the attendees, including a lady who long fought for the environment. It was time for Poland to speak at the podium. The Crusader presented himself as a leader of a movement within his country, which brought to justice one of bigger polutioners in the region (though noone recognized his name) and made a promise to transform Poland, away from carbon and smog. He then pleaded, that he can only archive that if the international community recognizes his state as New Poland. The lady among the attendees bursted into laugh with Wiech’s final words. She then stood up and walked straight to Jakub. It was Greta Thunberg, face of enviromentalist forces.\n\n“How dare you speak about transformation when he still oppresses enviromentalists” she spoke to Wiech. “How dare you speak about change when you’re just going to replace carbon with atom. How dare you even attend this summit when you do not even control all of Poland, and fight other warlords instead of negotiating with them. You think you’re so different from the monster you try to make out of Ziemkiewicz, but you’re just same as him”.\n\nWith those words, any excitement that Jakub Wiech made with his speech soon died and the humiliated leader had to leave Stockholm in shame."

atom_supreg.7.desc: "The minutes leading up to the meeting felt like an eternity. Jakub Wiech was alone, surrounded by a ravenous pack wishing nothing but his downfall. He tried to remain poised, but no matter where he placed his sight, he sensed a dozen angry gazes piercing his very soul, sizing him up, looking for any signs of weakness. The seat was painfully uncomfortable, and the complimentary glass of water tasted drier than the desert sands. Time seemed to slow to a crawl, each tick of the old analog clock sending a pang of anxiety through his chest. He was their rightful leader, but in this hostile den of wolves, Wiech felt small, like a bug waiting to be squashed. For the first time in many years, he experienced an emotion he thought he’d long left behind - fear. He could sense his initiative slipping. He knew he had to do something. He cleared his throat, rising up to speak. He could still salvage this… but even now, he was outplayed. \n\nBefore he could open his mouth, a booming voice stopped Jakub Wiech in his tracks, its gruff betraying the experience of the man sitting on the opposite end of the long, round table. \n-Mr. Wiech, you know our position. We don't want this protest either. Just stop your atomic farce, and we'll be back on our workstations by tomorrow. \nThe man was spouting utter nonsense, but in these unique conditions, the grizzled unionist sounded so commanding, so authoritative. It was enough to make the journalist's years of media training irrelevant, reducing his prepared stump speech into incoherent blabber. \n-You see... you're forgetting... nuclear energy is important... we need to build the power plant... it's for the good of nature... \nSeeing Wiech stumble on his words was more than enough to further elevate the union leader's confidence, and the back-and-forth of increasingly frustrated demands met with progressively weaker explanations soon led to the negotiations turning into a one-sided shouting match. It was a blowout. The ecologist knew what was coming, but no matter how hard he tried he simply couldn't find his groove. Each accusation sent him further into a corner from which there was no escape until his adversary finally uttered the sequence of words Wiech feared from the beginning of the exchange. \n-So are you gonna stop insulting my intelligence with your half-arsed justifications and do the right thing for damn once? Either you do as we say and never even dare utter the word 'atom' again, or we're done here. \n-I'm sorry, I just can't do that. Please, if you would listen... There are plenty of applications that would positively... \nBut the rest of his words fell on deaf ears. One by one, the strike leaders rose from their seats and left. Only the defeated Jakub Wiech remained in the room, slumped in his chair, the silence hurting him more than the dozens of insults thrown at him in those past few minutes. Not even he remembers how long it took him to gather the strength to get back up on his feet."

atom_supreg.8.desc:  "An emmisary was walking through the halls of Hôtel du ministre des Affaires étrangères, 37 Quai d'Orsay, Paris 7e to visit the French minister of foreign affairs, Catherine Colonna. There would be nothing unusual about this fact if it wasn't for the costume the ambassador was wearing. Piotr Napierała, Wiechowite Poland's minister of war, was heading into the negotiations wearing a copy of Napoleon's uniform. Even with the official authorization of the Atomic Crusade's government, the guards weren't sure whether to let him in, while the press was simply delighted to see something so unusual to feed their latest news cycle. Those backward conservatives and reactionaries back home, such as that meathead Gadomski, may think he's a clown, but their worldview prevents them from seeing the genius of his method. The French government will be hard-pressed by local commentators to accept a proposal from someone who so ostentatiously compliments the French nation.\n\nTime passed, and Napierała was getting closer to his destination. Just in time! The German ambassador preceding him was just leaving the minister's office. Seizing the opportunity, the Polish envoy sent his regards to the German nation by... sticking out his tongue in contempt.\n\n When he finally entered the office, he greeted Mrs. Colonna with a handshake and a slight bow.\n - Bonjour, madame la ministre. - Showing off his proficiency in French, Napierała decided to hold the talks in his host's language.\n - Bonjour - Colonna responded politely - I was told you wanted to discuss military contracts and supplies in case of any unexpected attack.\n - Indeed - Napierała knew she was trying her best not to explicitly say the matter concerned the German threat. He decided to play along. - I hope you can understand us. France is looking kindly on our cause. It is to be expected, given it's the birthplace of modern, enlightened Western civilization. Poland also has a chance to rise to such an esteemed level if only it can protect itself from nations that are... a western-eastern civilizational hybrid at best.\nHe looked deep into the minister's eyes to make sure she knew the meaning of his words. She knew.\n - Well, our government holds the expectation for a contract for your weapons. As well as a guarantee of our independence coupled with a defensive alliance.\n - Monsieur Napierała - Colonna responded - I thank you for your kind words about our nation. It is true your cause for a clean environment is dear to our hearts. We will certainly let you purchase our weapons at a fair price, but I am afraid we cannot come to your aid in case of invasion. You have to understand: your government has far too little international legitimacy for us to do that. The best we can do is to sign a non-aggression pact.\nNapierała was clearly disturbed by this turn of events.\n - Thank you for what you have already promised us. - He tried to maintain his composure - But you must realize: Our country is young and already fatigued by ever-lasting struggle. We may collapse without substantial external help.\n - I am sorry, monsieur Napierała. There is nothing more we can do."

Owe magazyny były najstarszymi w jednostce, zapieczętowane szczelnie od czasów Pierwszej Krucjaty. Atomowej, a nie tej do Ziemi Świętej oczywiście. Wielkie hale wypełnione bronią skrywały jednak nie święte granaty ręczne, ale coś co w obecnej sytuacji geopolitycznej przyda się o wiele bardziej. Ciężki sprzęt.\n\nRafał z Mirosławem weszli podziemnym tunelem do pierwszego z magazynów. Dookoła zalegały zamknięte skrzynie, na których można było ledwie odczytać napisy: AMUNICJA, KILOFY, GRANATY NAPALMOWE. Mirkowi widząc tę ostatnią natychmiast przeszła chęć na papierosa. Tym co jest tu zgromadzone możnaby wysadzić połowę Łodzi. A drugie pół by spłonęło z wrażenia. Rafał podszedł do skrzynki kontrolnej i włączył oświetlenie sali. I wtedy dopiero Mirek ujrzał absolutny gigantyzm zgromadzonych tu maszyn.\n\n- Rafał, co to do cholery jest? - zapytał Mirek wskazując palcem na stojący najbliżej ogromny czołg z dwiema lufami. Był imponujących rozmiarów ale nie wyglądał jakby miał gdzieś pojechać w najbliższej przyszłości.\n- To mój drogi jest prototypowy czołg który przejęli nasi gdy weszli do fabryk porzuconych przez Bractwo. Mówili na niego Koala. Trochę ich zdążyli naklepać, i nie wszystkie wysadzili. Jest jeden problem. To absolutny szajs. Układ paliwowy przecieka bardziej niż dziurawe gacie, układ kierowniczy to dramat, ten kloc w ogóle nie skręca.\n- To nie wygląda jakby miało w ogóle w zamierzeniu skręcać. No i chyba błotnika mu brakuje - zauważył Mirek. Faktycznie, co drugi czołg był w jakimś stopniu wybrakowany.\n- A o tym to nawet mi nie mów, gdzie ja Ci drugi taki błotnik dostanę? W ogóle wyobrażasz sobie ile to diabelstwo pali? - kontynuował swój wywód Rafał\n- Czego, węgla?\n- Geniuszu, może i oni byli durni ale czołgi to chyba musieli robić na paliwko, nie?\n- No dobrze, dobrze, dużo tego tutaj? - Mirek szybko chciał zmienić temat\n- Z kilkadziesiąt sztuk mamy, policzmy je szybko to Ci pokażę jak węglowcy zmasakrowali Ospreya. - Mirek na dźwięk tych słów zrobił minę jakby się przesłyszał.\n- Oni mieli Ospreye?! - Rafał roześmiał się. On jeszcze nie wie że żaden z tych gruzów nie wyszedł nigdy poza rejon fabryki. I nie życzył nikomu znalezienia się w środku któregokolwiek z tych wymysłów chorego industrializmu."

Incydentów przygranicznych codziennie było przynajmniej kilka, ale na szczęście żaden z nich nie stał się zarzewiem otwartej wojny. Tym z góry zawsze udało się załagodzić sytuację. Wczoraj Niemcy symulowali utratę panowania nad łodzią i pustą krypą staranowali nasz patrolowiec. Na szczęście nikomu się nic nie stało.

Dlatego też Jakub Wiech, rozumiejąc powagę sytuacji, każdą możliwą chwilę starał się spędzać na konsultacjach z kanclerzem Niemiec by rozbroić tę tykającą bombę. Ale to wszystko była syzyfowa praca. Niemcy wcale nie pomagali, wręcz wydawać by się mogło że celowo zaogniają konflikt by doprowadzić do otwartej wojny.\n\nWóz albo przewóz.

Proszę do mnie nie dzwonić w innej sprawie niż zapraszam.\nWiech zagotował się. Ich ignorancja oraz wyższość to tylko pozory. Przycisnąć ich, a w końcu pękną. Nie są gotowi na to co im przyszykowaliśmy.\n- Jestem śmiertelnie poważny. Jednocześnie chciałem poinformować, że wszystkie wolne narody Europy wzywają reżim w Berlinie do rozwiązania Unii Europejskiej w jej obecnym kształcie. Nowa organizacja międzynarodowa zajmie jej miejsce, bez niemieckiego imperializmu. Dodatkowo macie 5 lat na zrezygnowanie z zatruwania środowiska poprzez zamknięcie wszystkich elektrowni węglowych. Zanim się jakkolwiek odezwiesz to wiedz, że stoją ze mną wszystkie uciskane państwa europejskie. Wy nie wiecie kim my jesteśmy, wam się tylko wydaje. Na koniec tylko powiem, że ta rozmowa transmitowana jest na całą Europę. I zwrócę się też do was, obywatele niemieccy. Zrzućcie jarzmo neoimperialnego oprawcy i wyzwólcie swój kraj. W innym przypadku spadnie na was gniew całego wolnego świata jeżeli spróbujecie jeszcze raz prowokować wojnę. Żegnam.\n\nWiech rzucił słuchawką nie czekając na odpowiedź i opadł wyczerpany na fotel. Serce mu biło jak szalone, w głowie pędziły mu setki myśli, ale jednocześnie czuł wielką ulgę. Nie wiadomo jaka będzie reakcja Berlina ale zabezpieczył sobie wszystkie możliwe wyjścia.

Nikt nas nie zauważa. Grzesiek wyciąga flagę Krucjaty, i zaczyna krzyczeć:\n- NIECH ŻYJE ATOMOWA POLSKA, PRECZ Z IMPERIALIZMEM NIEMIECKIM\nIroniczne, sami popełniamy akt najwyższego terroryzmu. Ale w domu nie będą na to patrzeć w ten sposób. To zwycięstwo. 15 sekund. Strażnicy nas zauważyli i biegną w naszą stronę. Nasze poświęcenie obudzi naród polski i wkroczy on na drogę ku zwycięstwu. 10 sekund. Z Polski właśnie wyjdzie iskra która podpali cały świat, ale nie żeby go zniszczyć, lecz odnowić. Za wolność. 5. Naszą. 4. I waszą. 3. \n- RZUĆ FLAGĘ I NA ZIEMIĘ - krzyknął jeden ze strażników po niemiecku\nDwa. \n- Widzimy się w piekle - rzuciłem pod nosem\nJeden.\n\nOślepiający błysk poraził całą populację Berlina, nad niemiecką stolicą pojawiło się drugie słońce. Jeszcze tylko chwila, i wszystko przestanie mieć znaczenie. Fala uderzeniowa zmiata wszystko co napotka na swojej drodze. Kula ognia rozprzestrzenia się i czuć już jej ciepło. Za moment już ogarnie nas atom, i odejdziemy z tego świata jako jedność scalona w symfoni pożogi. Poczułem palący ból. A potem było tylko światło."

atom_plant.16.desc: "We have done it. \nCentral Poland once again feasts on energy from Bełchatów, this time generated by a newer, cleaner, better provider built on top of the previous one. -- An industrial machine to better the ol' smog-spewing monstrosity that has been finally sent into eternal slumber. \n\n\nAgainst all odds - the civil war, the devastated economy, the populace's sentiment - we have managed what half-a-century of previous governments didn't manage to do. \n\nWe can be proud of ourselves... \nWe finally gave Poland the Atom."
