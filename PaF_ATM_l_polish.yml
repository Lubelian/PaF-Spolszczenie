POLITICS_WIECH_DESC: "In many ways, Jakub Wiech is the antithesis of Ziemkiewicz's teachings, the perfect boogeyman to pin all the blame for the Brotherhood's failures on. Though mountains of propaganda have long distorted nearly all of the journalist's ideals, labeling his band of misfits as pawns in some unknown global conspiracy to take down the 'last bastion of progress,' the true danger Wiech poses for Bełchatów's elite lies not in the differences, but the similarities between him and Ziemkiewicz. As a lifelong proponent of moderate conservatism, the journalist could have felt right at home in the state his nemesis created. Perhaps in another world, they could have been allies, but in a nation built on the dogma of coal's superiority, any suggestion to the contrary is nothing less than treasonous heresy. \n\nThough he was always unwelcome on the Brotherhood's territory, nothing could stop Wiech from exposing the truth about the dangers the faction posed not just to Poland but the entire world. Despite his life being at risk every time he spoke, the journalist railed on about the need for a transition from the rapidly depleting fossil fuels to the near-infinite, sustainable power of atom. Wherever he appeared, a following sprung up, clinging to his ideals for hope amidst Ziemkiewicz's growing fanaticism. Each speech, every citizen brought to the nuclear cause weakened the Brotherhood's regime, even if just a little, sparking hope for much-needed reform. Soon, however, the days of peacefully changing the minds of Łódzkie's citizens would be over as the region's overlords sought to crack down on what they viewed as a plague spreading through their lands. \n\nJakub Wiech never wished to be a leader, but without him, the nuclear movement would perish, violently snuffed out by Ziemkiewicz and his lackeys. Despite knowing what fate awaits him if he fails, the journalist ignited an open rebellion against the Brotherhood's forces, launching the Atomic Crusade to restore sanity to the voivodeship. Some might say the odds he faces are insurmountable, that he has only doomed his followers to serve as cannon fodder for the experienced paladins, but that has never deterred Wiech before. All his life, he has battled for the nuclear cause, and he will not relent now. Even if he has to die for it, his sacrifice will forever be immortalized."
