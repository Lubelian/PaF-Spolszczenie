POLITICS_WIECH_DESC: "In many ways, Jakub Wiech is the antithesis of Ziemkiewicz's teachings, the perfect boogeyman to pin all the blame for the Brotherhood's failures on. Though mountains of propaganda have long distorted nearly all of the journalist's ideals, labeling his band of misfits as pawns in some unknown global conspiracy to take down the 'last bastion of progress,' the true danger Wiech poses for Bełchatów's elite lies not in the differences, but the similarities between him and Ziemkiewicz. As a lifelong proponent of moderate conservatism, the journalist could have felt right at home in the state his nemesis created. Perhaps in another world, they could have been allies, but in a nation built on the dogma of coal's superiority, any suggestion to the contrary is nothing less than treasonous heresy. \n\nThough he was always unwelcome on the Brotherhood's territory, nothing could stop Wiech from exposing the truth about the dangers the faction posed not just to Poland but the entire world. Despite his life being at risk every time he spoke, the journalist railed on about the need for a transition from the rapidly depleting fossil fuels to the near-infinite, sustainable power of atom. Wherever he appeared, a following sprung up, clinging to his ideals for hope amidst Ziemkiewicz's growing fanaticism. Each speech, every citizen brought to the nuclear cause weakened the Brotherhood's regime, even if just a little, sparking hope for much-needed reform. Soon, however, the days of peacefully changing the minds of Łódzkie's citizens would be over as the region's overlords sought to crack down on what they viewed as a plague spreading through their lands. \n\nJakub Wiech never wished to be a leader, but without him, the nuclear movement would perish, violently snuffed out by Ziemkiewicz and his lackeys. Despite knowing what fate awaits him if he fails, the journalist ignited an open rebellion against the Brotherhood's forces, launching the Atomic Crusade to restore sanity to the voivodeship. Some might say the odds he faces are insurmountable, that he has only doomed his followers to serve as cannon fodder for the experienced paladins, but that has never deterred Wiech before. All his life, he has battled for the nuclear cause, and he will not relent now. Even if he has to die for it, his sacrifice will forever be immortalized."

##Ideas and Spirits##
ATM_overextended_army: "Przeciążona armia"
ATM_overextended_army_desc: "The Crusade, as our movement has come to be called, is not exactly a shining example of a standing army. At first, our disorganized revolt against the Brotherhood didn't necessarily call for anything more sophisticated than a mass of fervent militias, but now that we’ve actually secured control over the voivodeship, problems have begun to spring up like mushrooms. \n\nBrotherhood remnants terrorize our administration, petty crime has been on a steady rise, and our neighbors are already eyeing our sparsely protected borders for any land they could grab up for themselves. The few gasps of air left in the army are being constantly squeezed out by nigh constant cross-border raids and bouts with bandits. \n\nUnless we want to fall to rebellion or crumple from a single blow from the other voivodeships, we have no choice but to reform our army into something we could actually be proud of."

ATM_indoctrinated_society: "Zindoktrynowane społeczeństwo"
ATM_indoctrinated_society_desc: "Mindless drones with smog-shrouded eyes. That could definitely be one way to describe the citizens of Bełchatów. It’s a real curiosity how effective the Brotherhood's propaganda machine once was. Even when cut off from their endless stream of fake news and fear-mongering fanatics, their belief in the clique’s ideals remains unshaken. Their lives are so habitual that one could mistake them for workers in an ant farm if seen from a bird’s eye view. \n\nThey're fearful of the Atom, afraid of any perceived retribution that the Crusade might carry out on them. Everything that wasn’t personally approved and endorsed by Ziemkiewicz is treated like a plague. Surprisingly, their poison had even managed to seep into the minds of the voivodeship’s population at large. Those who might’ve been at least somewhat skeptical of renewable or nuclear sources of energy have become radicalized to the point of hating the color green. \n\nThe future will tell if there’s any hope of bringing real reason back to these people. Not the twisted 'common sense' touted by Ziemkiewicz."

ATM_ravaged_countryside: "Ravaged Countryside"
ATM_ravaged_countryside_desc: "Everywhere you turn in the Łódź Voivodeship, all that can be seen is destruction. The Fall, the Brotherhood's policies, the war fought between the warlords, and eventually even our rebellion against the former despots has left the region in total ruin. While the cities still stand, only nominally damaged by the fighting, they will soon start to feel the effects of the damage inflicted upon the land. \n\nArable lands have been poisoned by the gray clouds of smog overhead, while reckless industrialism jabbed its fangs into the country's lifeblood. The Brotherhood’s failed attempts to prevent the Blackout have also left the many once beautiful forests as fields of stumps and trampled greenery. \n\nProblems only get worse the closer one gets to Bełchatów and its very own electric monster. That coal-churning machine has caused so much damage to the ecosystem that we’re not sure if anything healthy will be able to grow near it for a long time. \n\nIt is now our duty to man the shovels and plows and reclaim the soot-stained land one sapling at a time."

ATM_revitalizing_countryside: "Revitalizing Countryside"
ATM_revitalizing_countryside_desc: "It took some time before the first batch of seeds sprouted rather than wilted. Seeing generation after generation fail to grow in the contaminated ground tested our faith, but in the end, it only made the eventual harvest sweeter. It will take many years before the soil is fully healed. Some damage might even be permanent, but even the few stunted potatoes we manage to grow are better than facing a full-blown famine. It ain't much, but it's honest work."

ATM_pentomic_army: "Armia Pentomiczna"
ATM_pentomic_army_desc: "In a nuclear battlefield, the concentration of forces into a traditional spearhead presents a perfect target for the employment of tactical nuclear weapons. In response to that, the Pentomic doctrine counters the threat by dividing each formation into five subordinate units, able to deploy and engage in operations far more rapidly than conventional brigades, all while possessing greater offensive capabilities than conventional battalions.\nThe pentomic concept organizes what would normally be parts of several different units into a more balanced division, reducing the need for communications between different command structures that could incur delays."

ATM_climate_agency: "Krajowa Agencja Klimatyczna"
ATM_climate_agency_desc: "Now that we've started our efforts to combat the smog, there needs to be a regulatory body to provide oversight and a sense of direction for it all. That would come in the form of the newly founded agency. The greatest minds that our post-Fall nation can offer will gather here to research, study, and put into action the initiatives necessary to bring Poland back to its former natural beauty. Water purification, carbon capture, and even radical transformations that could stall our economy will be undertaken if it means we can crush the scourge created by the Brotherhood’s greed."

ATM_gadomski_plan: "Plan Gadomskiego"
ATM_gadomski_plan_desc: "Being a combination of a robust system of private initiatives with a minute sprinkle of central planning thrown in, Gadomski's economic plan allows us to slowly put down the wounded behemoth that was the Brotherhood's industrial machine without incurring any unnecessary social and economic harm."

ATM_reduction_plan: "Great Reduction Plan"
ATM_reduction_plan_desc: "Animals, trees, and all other living things deserve our respect! Over its lifespan, the Brotherhood of Coal has been utterly wrecking the environment, the entire industry, and energy production, even domestic heating relied on coal! This caused astronomical damage, leading to the death of countless people and animals, while the vegetation was brought to the brink of destruction!\n\nThe environment is a common good for every human being; it's time to start caring for it before it's too late to go back. We need to modernize home heating systems that pollute the environment, transform factories into a more eco-friendly model, and power plants into modern, low-emission facilities. Caring for nature will bring us more benefits than destroying it! And there is a lot to be done to unwrap everything the Brotherhood has touched."

ATM_fear_of_the_atom: "Strach przed atomem"
ATM_fear_of_the_atom_desc: "Chernobyl, Fukushima, Bałuty. Those three names have been repeated like a mantra, permanently ingrained in the minds of the Polish people. The Brotherhood of Coal, throughout its rule, fueled a growing spiral of fear and hatred towards green and efficient nuclear energy through its vile pro-coal propaganda. However, today's technology is different, with significantly increased margins of error and complex safety systems. From its grave, Ziemkiewicz’s cult continues trying to steer us away from the vision of cheap and clean electricity.\n\nMoreover, the mere word 'atom' evokes fear following the still-unsolved catastrophe from a few years ago. It is not out of the question that the entire situation was a plot between Ziemkiewicz and the Germans, although no one has yet dared to say this out loud.\n\nOur priority is to change the mindset of our population. Broadcasts on the reborn radio, television, internet, or articles in newspapers are a good start on our way to creating a legion of nuclear energy supporters."

ATM_zeppelin_in_the_atomic_age_idea: "Atomic Age Zeppelins"
ATM_zeppelin_in_the_atomic_age_idea_desc: "Is there any skyfaring vessel mightier than the blimp? In a rare case of common ground, both we and Ziemkiewicz agree that the answer to this question is a resounding NO. Their plans were an inefficient mess that would either never get off the ground or simply explode the moment it's powered up, but they did have the right idea. Somewhere in his little shack, upon seeing this airborne colossus, an old Paladin sheds a tear of pride. His dreams of progress have become a reality, although under slightly different management."

ATM_eco_org_idea: "Environmental Organizations' Rebirth"
ATM_eco_org_idea_desc: "Have you ever looked at the sad state our environment finds itself in due to decades of pollution and neglect? Are you an advocate for sustainable growth that wishes to play no part in its further destruction? Do you want to turn the tide, stop climate change, and help restore the green soul of our planet? \n\nNow more than ever, Mother Nature needs brave souls to join the vanguard fighting for Earth's survival. Join Greenpeace today and help secure a better future for all of Gaia's children."

ATM_eco_org_idea2: "Environmental Scare"
ATM_eco_org_idea2_desc: "Have you ever stopped to consider whether the Wiechowites truly care about the environment? Are you discontent with constant empty promises while coal still burns in many factories around the nation? Do you want to stop the cultish devotion towards the Atom and focus on renewable energy sources that actually work? \n\nNow, more than ever, Mother Nature needs brave souls to stand strong against all those who wish to bastardize the fight for Earth's survival. Join Greenpeace today and help keep the environmental movement on the right track."

ATM_eco_org_idea3: "Environmental Menace"
ATM_eco_org_idea3_desc: "Have you noticed how voices calling for real clean energy are being suppressed? Are you done with the constant downward spiral caused by Wiech's neglect of the environment? Do you want to resist the atomic cultists before they destroy everything we cherish? \n\nNow, more than ever, Mother Nature needs brave souls to thwart all efforts at destroying our shared future. Join Greenpeace today and help stop the further development of harmful atomic technology."

ATM_eco_org_idea4: "Environmental Terror"
ATM_eco_org_idea4_desc: "Have you come to the conclusion that Wiechowites have forfeited their right to life the moment they declared war against our planet? Are you ready to fight back with everything you've got? Do you want to enact righteous vengeance on the climate movement's enemies? \n\nNow, more than ever, Mother Nature needs brave souls to kill all atomic scum and restore balance to the world. Join Greenpeace today and help take back the country in the name of Gaia."

ATM_oze_idea: "Renewable Energy Subsidies"
ATM_oze_idea_desc: "Trampling over birds, peculiar deserts, and fish, we stop at nothing to enable and finance every possible renewable energy source. Photovoltaics over every home, windmills over every hill, every river dammed. We don’t give a damn, as our journey towards full decarbonization cannot stop just because it takes more than a week to build a proper nuclear power plant. All this will net more energy, more space to phase out coal burning, and eventually save the planet - starting with this country."

ATM_captain_planet_idea: "Captain Planet"
ATM_captain_planet_idea_desc: "Heroes beget monikers. Most earn theirs in battle, some as recognition for the furthering of peace. A few come to be known for their shortcomings, while the unlucky ones end up with history's equivalent of a mocking nickname. \n\nJakub Wiech never thought he'd be remembered as anything but a semi-recognized journalist who tried speaking truth to power, yet the threads of fate guided him through the most remarkable story of redemption and triumph. \n\nHis title - 'Captain Planet' may not mean much to the outside viewer, but for us, it's a symbol of a new, better age; a reminder of all the challenges we've overcome."

ATM_rad_eaters_idea: "Rad-Eaters"
ATM_rad_eaters_idea_desc: "Just as pre-Fall Poland had its GROM and Ziemkiewicz could always rely on an elite contingent of Paladins, so too can we count on the rad-eaters to do all our dirty work. Armed to the teeth with the latest generation of stealth weaponry and dedicated enough to give their lives for the atomic cause without a single hitch, our mindless brutes have only one purpose in life - to kill for the glory of the Crusade. \n\nWatch out, enemies of the Atom. Death will come for you when you least expect it."

ATM_atoms_bulwark: "Atom's Bulwark"
ATM_atoms_bulwark_desc: "A little rock radiates with power the likes of which we haven't seen before. It begs to be used. It wants us to take advantage of its gifts. It's potent. Too potent, even. An infinite abyss, pulling our gaze in, inviting us to stare longingly into its dark depths. If we're not careful, it will forever change us. We must keep it chained; limit its usage to only that which benefits without harm. Otherwise, the lust for power might overwhelm us. Yet, is it not a sin to refuse to ponder the limits of our strength? Especially now that we've reached the precipice of omnipotence? We could be gods amongst men... \nSo, what shall be our legacy?"

ATM_bulwark_safe: "Atom's Bulwark - Safety"
ATM_bulwark_safe_desc: "Ultimate power comes with a great responsibility. Those who utilize it for nefarious purposes are bound to go down in history as its greatest villains, as even victors are eventually crushed by the weight of their moral crimes. Rather than condemn ourselves to follow the murky path of utilitarian justifications, we'd much prefer to assume the position of benevolent keepers of the Atom's secrets, dispensing its benefits to the worthy and keeping those blinded by hate and ambition from unlocking its true potential. Giving in to the corruption is easy. Instead, we'll prove our ability to stay above the fray and remain true to our original promise."

ATM_bulwark_deadly: "Atom's Bulwark - Lethality"
ATM_bulwark_deadly_desc: "Condemning one or condemning a million? Seems like an easy choice, right? Instead of bowing down to the whims of a bunch of moralists who've spent their entire lives sheltered from the cruelty of the wider world, we follow that which grants us survival, even at the cost of a few extra casualties. In our grim reality, things often boil down to a simple principle - 'eat or be eaten,' and we've come too far to see everything slip through our fingers. Come what may, we'd rather be alive and feared than dead and revered. History's written by the victors anyway."

ATM_maria_II_reactor: "'MARIA II' Nuclear Reactor"
ATM_maria_II_reactor_desc: "Built in record time considering the conditions prevailing in post-Fall Poland, the first block of the nuclear power plant in Bełchatów has been completed, named in honor of the famous MARIA Research Reactor in Świerk.\n\nSince block No. 12, instead of steam boilers, was equipped with turbines, this allowed for the simplification of the adaptation process of existing water recirculation systems to the current MARIA II reactor.\n\nThis unit can generate 1000MW of energy, making it both "cleaner" and more efficient than the old power block which boasted a capacity of 850MW.\n\nTruly an impressive achievement to build a reactor in a war zone.\nJust hope nothing happens to it..."

ATM_consortium_supplies: "Supplies from the Consortium"
ATM_consortium_supplies_desc: "The top brass of the Consortium, even though it has long ceased to have anything to manage, still exists. Left to their own devices, they descended into the underground, trying to save their businesses from the oppressor.\n\nBut, there is a green oasis amidst the sea of gray that is the Brotherhood.\n\nNow as we engage in a full-scale battle against the Brotherhood of Coal, support is actually flowing to us from the Consortium. It includes funds from Skrzydlewski, weapons from Rutkowski, and ambulances left behind by Ebrantil, which bolster our ranks and treasury, allowing us to continue the fight against Ziemkiewicz.\n\nThe Consortium, like any business, prefers to label this as an investment rather than material aid. They are counting on the possibility of emerging from the underground.\n\nOnly time will tell whether this investment will pay off for them..."

ATM_diverting_resources_idea: "Diverting Resources"
ATM_diverting_resources_idea_desc: "Building a nuclear reactor is by no means as simple as it may seem at first glance.\n\nIn order to counteract the catastrophe imposed upon us by the Brotherhood, we need to build one as quickly as possible. This task requires quite an assortment of materials.\n\nHundreds of tonnes of concrete and steel, dozens of tonnes of electronic and mechanical components, as well as many tonnes of things as mundane as asphalt or gravel for building access roads, or ceramics for employee toilets. It all must be produced somewhere.\n\nThat's why we need to shift the tracks of our economy. The only goal that should guide us now is the fastest possible completion of the project. All while maintaining certain safety standards, of course."

ATM_belchatow_failed: "Failed Nuclear Program"
ATM_belchatow_failed_desc: "§RIt happened...\nEveryone feared it, and it actually happened...§!\n\nDue to a poorly designed cooling system, the reactor core melted down. Firefighters and employees of the Bełchatów Nuclear Power Plant immediately began to mitigate the consequences and thanks to the efforts of our heroes, we practically minimized any probability of contaminating the atmosphere and soil in the region, thus averting an environmental disaster.\n\nThis situation forced the authorities at the highest level to create a safety cordon around the entire "Danger Zone" to isolate people from potential threats.\n\nHowever, even worse is that we lost the trust of the society.\n\nChernobyl, Fukushima and Bałuty - a large part of our nation already harbors a fear of nuclear energy. Now, Bełchatów joins this group, and it's likely that we will never be able to resume a nuclear program in our homeland in the future, despite it still being the safest form of energy ever.\n\nUnfortunately, people know otherwise…"

ATM_pacification: "Akcja pacyfikacyjna"
ATM_pacification_desc: "The murder of a high-ranking official working on the development of atomic energy is an unacceptable act of barbaric terrorism! Butchers from Greenpeace, most likely funded by Germany, have formed militant groups that destabilize the internal situation! The UN decided to be UNinvolved in any of the peace talks, and the people who succumbed to their propaganda of fear have taken to the streets.\n\nThe negotiations were short.\n\nUnfortunately, as much as we’d like to avoid it, we must respond with force. It is time to pacify the strikes and combat the Greenpeace militants. It is not an easy task, as some of the fanatics are ready to die for their quixotic struggle, but their lives are a sacrifice we’re willing to make because in order to unite the country, we need to stabilize our internal situation."

ATM_atomic_science: "Nauka atomowa"
ATM_atomic_science_desc: "As the nation’s education system is being reanimated, our Crusade steers it as hard as possible towards hard sciences, especially everything nuclear: Nuclear physics, engineering, and then some, all are given the best professors from abroad and within alike, its students receiving generous scholarships and loans for sometimes little more than passing the first year. Such a focus on physics and engineering is bound to grant us a plentiful and dedicated cadre of scientists focused on exactly what our movement is all about."

ATM_civilian_usage: "Civilian Usage of Uranium"
ATM_civilian_usage_desc: "Atomic science isn't all about nuclear warheads and flashy reactor megaprojects. Sometimes what really matters are the seemingly uninteresting, mundane applications. An unassuming radioisotope saving the life of a terminally ill patient. A new imaging technique detecting a minor leak before it compromises an entire pipeline. A radioactive element that kills pests better than any conventional chemical. Most lesser warlords would scoff at our policy to shove the Atom into nearly every facet of daily life, but that's exactly what helps us maintain a constant edge over our competitors. They can laugh, but those little glowing rocks are the key to our victory."

ATM_cleansing_ranks: "Cleansing the Ranks"
ATM_cleansing_ranks_desc: "Inheriting things from your predecessors is a great thing until you have to take care of pest control. It's manageable when the prize ain't bigger than a house, but when you've got an entire spy agency infested with roaches, rats, and chameleons, you'll need far more than a can of bug spray. In the dying days of the Brotherhood, Janecki filled his creation with as much poisonous carbon agenda as the four walls of the organization's headquarters could fit. Don't you worry, though. We'll pluck out each and every last one of those pesky weeds."

ATM_fission_desc: "After years of meticulous preparations right under Ziemkiewicz's nose in the ruins of Bałuty, we are ready to give the Brotherhood what they asked for. What they feared. What they rambled on about in their unhinged speeches. An Atomic Crusade. We believe it is not too late to save Poland from those carbon cooks, even if the desolation all around us begs to differ. But first, before we truly get going, our cause needs to gain sufficient popular support by exposing the Brotherhood's lies. They think that thanks to their subservient propaganda tubes, they have the monopoly of truth, but they couldn't be more wrong. And what better way to show everyone the extent of their deception than through a proclamation by the 'long-dead' Jakub Wiech?"
ATM_supplies_from_lodz_desc: "Although our campaign of armed resistance against the Brotherhood is still in its early stages, we have been preparing for the uprising for a considerable amount of time. Over the years, we've established numerous hidden supply caches in the dark corners of the urban jungle of Łódź, containing everything from makeshift guns and homemade explosives to primitive anti-armor weapons that could hopefully make a dent in the enemy's elite units. Thanks to our cooperation with local partisan groups, even the city's current occupation and brutal crackdowns by Ziemkiewicz's forces failed to compromise the safety of our brilliantly concealed contraband. Now that the moment is right and we've openly taken up arms, we can finally put our cloaked weapons to good use against our nemesis."
ATM_apocalyptic_roads_desc: "As the Brotherhood's conquests grew, so did its complacency. Being the obsessive narcissists that they are, Bełchatów's elite quickly came to believe their own propaganda about their invincible might, fully convinced that anyone who opposed them was far beneath them. Soon, the armed escorts tasked with protecting the convoys transporting crucial goods across the voivodeship became lighter and lighter by the day as the illusion of safety became ingrained in the Paladins' minds. Now that we're openly at war, these convoys have become fair game, and we can exploit their lowered guard to claim their precious supplies for our own. No road will be safe. No transport will be beyond our reach. We'll completely paralyze the Brotherhood, cutting off all circulation of resources between their garrisons."
ATM_strike_at_nucleus_desc: "We always knew this day would come. Even before the Fall, the Bełchatów Power Plant has been a thorn in the side of every ecologist on this side of the Oder. It's efficient, painfully efficient even, spewing deadly black smoke from its chimneys at breakneck speeds, but all of that be damned, the Paladins turned it into a symbol to rally behind. Now it's time to crush this symbol once and for all. The goal is simple - we have to show the populace that even the places most sacred to the Brotherhood are not invulnerable. A propaganda victory will be more than enough as actually destroying the whole facility through sabotage only would be a near-impossible task, not what we'd even wish to try, as Wiech seems to have his own plans regarding the future of the power plant."
ATM_reach_the_dissidents_desc: "The inner machinations of the council are... murky at best. The four Paladins cloistered themselves in a porcelain tower, seemingly out of reach, but there appear to be some cracks in their structure. While the other members burn like their beloved coal with passion and rave against the atom like there's no tomorrow, Gadomski has always been an outsider, whether it comes to fervor, journalistic background, or economic policies. We'll have to proceed with great caution so as not to compromise our intelligence, but we should seize upon the opportunity to reach him and convince him to break ranks and help us navigate the dysfunctional machine that is Brotherhood's economy."
ATM_black_market_connections_desc: "Our way of life in the underground prevents us from specializing in any particular field without heavily compromising another. Our agents have to be self-sufficient and adaptive. Over the course of our forced exile in Bałuty, we've mastered the art of scavenging, but thus far,  we haven't been able to train any specialized weapon smugglers. We'll need some outside help to provide us with more advanced weaponry than a bunch of makeshift rifles and baseball bats. It's time to dip into the moral grey and strike a deal with the weapon dealers in the black market. There isn't much we can offer the merchants of death in our current state, but we'll make sure they'll be handsomely repaid once all is said and done."
ATM_makeshift_workshops_desc: "The Brotherhood's structure may not be nearly as rotten as we thought. The first encounters with their soldiers proved the war effort will likely require far more equipment than the meager caches we hid in Łódź or the slow trickle of guns bought from the black market. We'll need production centers, and we'll need them fast. Constructing permanent military factories is out of the question in our current, rugged conditions, however, setting up simpler installations should still be on the table. Makeshift workshops won't provide the best quality equipment, but they should suffice to fill the holes in our supply chain for the time being."
ATM_god_particles_desc: "Appeal to old Razemites' love for the Atom. Point to the usage of nuclear power by Israel. Claim you give them the chance to fight Azazel himself! We don't know what else one can do to convince the Widzew Jews to help us, but surely our diplomats can figure out every trick in the book. Have them study the Talmud to get some clues on any bits of doctrine that may come in handy. Make sure they can hold up to the scrutiny of even the most critical rabbis. Just don't be stereotypical by trying to stuff money down their noses in exchange for support. Unless that proves necessary..."
ATM_red_forest_desc: "Well, this should be easy. If there's any faction that hates Ziemkiewicz's reign as much as we do, it's got to be the nature-loving scouts. We can't be sure how they view nuclear energy given their tendency for obscurantism, but even they'll have to see we're, at the very least, the lesser of two evils. The plan is simple - show up, rile them up against our enemies, and watch as the forests erupt in a flurry of anger.\nAnd if we can't convince the forest-worshippers that a regime characterized by its smog-spewing smokestacks, that literally worships pollution, is evil... Well, we may as well call off the whole Crusade at that point."
ATM_nuclear_commando_desc: "There must be some of Sapkowski's lackeys we could recycle from past campaigns to gain an advantage. While the worshippers of the Eternal Flame have most likely already joined the ranks of the Brotherhood due to their strongly conservative outlook, knightly aesthetic, and love for burning things, it's safe to assume we should be at least somewhat successful with recruiting the more progressive and ecologically-minded Scoia’tael. They're... extravagant to say the least, and our grander plans are likely to go way over their heads, but all that matters is they know how to fight. Those savages can even treat atomic energy as just another kind of magic for all we care."
ATM_send_the_courier_desc: "Due to it being the most densely populated area in the entire voivodeship, it should be relatively easy to gain considerable support in Łódź proper. Besides, it's a far more manageable task to infiltrate a large city where you can make yourself disappear in every dark alleyway or sketchy apartment, rather than some village where every elder knows all the goings-on. We just need to send one of our agents, disguised as a simple courier, so that he may rally the dispersed rebel cells and lead the assault to secure the fortified positions built by Hołownia's government."
ATM_blood_money_desc: "Skrzydlewski and his family surely can't be happy about the state of their flowers under the Brotherhood's regime. Even if he can compensate for that loss with the increased demand for funerals resulting from copious smog-related lung diseases, we can capitalize on the looming danger of nationalization at the whims of Ziemkiewicz to bring him to our side. Couple those arguments with some immediate generous bribes and the promise of more once we take the voivodeship, and we've got an offer that old scoundrel can't refuse. The squarehead should listen to his boss like an obedient dog, and as long as they keep the third guy in check, we're golden."

ATM_decarbonization_desc: "It's... over. The Brotherhood has fallen. We've long dreaded the moment the guns finally go silent, as by all means, we should have been the vanquished. And yet, we stand victorious, with a country to run and our former enemies to judge. Only now that the drums of war have stopped beating and the euphoria of triumph subdued has the sheer scale of the damage become evident. We rule over ruins and wastelands, smog-covered cities, and fields unfit for cultivation. Carbon has destroyed Łódzkie, scarring the land far worse than the bomb could have ever done. Now, the real work begins to undo the devastation so willingly embraced by our predecessors. Though in its dying throes, it has entrenched itself into the ecosystem and the people's minds, the darkness of carbon shall give way to the light of atom."
ATM_brother_ziemkiewicz_desc: "Oh, how wonderfully have the tables turned. Our greatest enemy, the face of the Brotherhood, the man who tried to root us all out, now finds himself at our mercy.  The recent string of defeats has exposed Ziemkiewicz for who he really is - a raving lunatic lost in his own delusions of grandeur. Aside from serving as his clique's figurehead, he held little true power, overshadowed by his more methodical puppet masters. As tempting as it may be to fully exact our revenge, there is one thing we have to acknowledge - Ziemkiewicz is no threat. Still, the lives lost due to his mad ramblings must be avenged, and our supporters chant in unison for a particular verdict - death. A little bit of leniency could go a long way toward rehabilitating our more moderate opponents, but can we really let such a monster live after all the suffering he's caused us?"
ATM_brother_warzecha_desc: "Of all our fallen foes, none deserves immediate retribution more than 'Paladin' Warzecha - the true architect of the Brotherhood's system of cruelty and exploitation. For years, the little rat cowered behind his more popular colleagues, pulling the strings of Poland's destruction from behind the scenes. Every decision that set Bełchatów's clique further down its dark path has a paper trail leading back to one man - the embodiment of all of the Brotherhood's worst qualities. Warzecha is irredeemable. Given another chance, he'd gladly do it all over again, damning millions to live in a polluted wasteland without ever losing that smug little grin of his. The verdict has already been decided. The bastard has to die for his crimes, and we'll gladly watch the sentence carried out, filled with a particular sense of satisfaction."
ATM_deindoctrination_desc: "Besides the environmental disaster rapidly unfolding before us, another, more humanitarian tragedy has entrenched itself. The constant stream of unchallenged propaganda spewed out by the Brotherhood's news outlets has whittled down the minds of the populace, turning them into willing participants in their own nation's suicide. They cling to the teachings of their clueless masters, embracing policies that will destroy all they've ever known as dogma. Though even if they oppose us, they're not our enemies, but victims, broken and in need of guidance. Convincing them of the righteousness of our ways will be a long and arduous process, but through baby steps, we'll help them break free from the lies once more."
ATM_saving_polish_microclimates_desc: "Flowers wither in the chemically polluted ground. Contaminated rivers flow through forests of stumps. Wild beasts starve as their food chain lies broken. Poland stands amid a total, self-inflicted, environmental collapse - one that will take the combined effort of multiple generations to offset. We inherited a region destroyed by unchecked industrial expansion to a point where the constant need for more resources threatened not just the balance of the ecosystem, but the survival of the population altogether. As much as we need it, there is sadly no miraculous solution, only a slow, difficult recovery. To that end, we must form a governmental climate agency to assess what has been lost, what can still be saved, and where we can pour our funds to really make a change. Little by little, nature will return, even if just a shadow of its former self."
ATM_acknowledge_global_warming_desc: "Long gone are the days when fearsome winters gripped Poland, and a blanket of snow covered the land for months on end. But the images of snowball fights and downhill sled races are not just a case of nostalgia towards the blissful days of youth, and neither is their disappearance a coincidence, but an example of something greater, something far more sinister - climate change. For too long has the government blankly rejected all evidence of humanity's disastrous effects on the environment, all while actively contributing to the process's acceleration. No more. We are all complicit in mankind's greatest crime against nature, and it's high time we take responsibility for the damage we've caused. In a war against the Earth, there can be no victors, so if there is to be any future for our life on this planet, we will all do our part to finally make things right."
ATM_destroy_malicious_media_desc: "In the Brotherhood, only one truth existed, diligently spewed out by a myriad of government-funded publications. Though they attempted to discern themselves and pretended to be more than just thoughtless propaganda tubes, they shared one thing in common - the lack of any journalistic integrity in their advocacy for Ziemkiewicz's harmful policies. While it will take a long time to combat the misinformation already implanted into the citizens' heads, we can at least stop its further spread.  The major media conglomerates, such as the madman's beloved 'Do Rzeczy' will be broken up and replaced with a number of independent papers promoting our narrative. The lesser outlets will continue operating,   albeit under heavy scrutiny and anti-coal bend to deradicalize their readers. The war for the people's minds has only begun, and these publications will serve as our frontline soldiers."
ATM_industrial_cults_desc: "Not even an institution as sacred as the Church found itself spared of the meddling of Ziemkiewicz's cronies, bastardized into a twisted form of itself that spread not the word of God, but the clique's industrialist agenda. After years of such dogma spewing from the altars, many of the more devout have started worshiping coal as their Golden Calf. They pray to it, surround themselves with it, tout its glory in hidden meetings. We must restore the church back to its former glory and rid it of these corrupt influences by rehabilitating the disgraced pastors who refused to cooperate in the corruption of their flock. Eventually, we will bring the lost lambs back to their holy shepherd. So help us God."
ATM_brother_rzymkowski_desc: "Just like lambs spared from the slaughter, so too are we gathered to pass judgment on our former killer. All the massacres, all the war crimes, everything can be traced back to one man - the butcher of Bełchatów, Paladin Rzymkowski. While many of our foes, shorn of their commander's protection, claim to have been merely following orders, this genocidal maniac's tactics had nothing to do with war. Had he gotten his way, each and every last one of us would've ended up six feet under, with a bullet to the back of the head to end their struggle and a mass grave to bury their legacy. There is no punishment fit for this bastard except that which he so willingly dispensed. There will be no second chances, only the satisfaction of our brethren's lives avenged. Rzymkowski does not deserve more."
ATM_brotherhood_arms_industry_desc: "Now that the Brotherhood's war machine has been stopped, only the factories that fueled it remain, some dormant, some still working to supply the fallen behemoth. The military industry left behind by our fallen foes is impressive, but it is misguided at best. Just like the whole state it armed - wasteful beyond belief. All it did was suck further resources out of the already depleted region, bringing the environmental doomsday clock closer to midnight with each shell produced. The only way to stop this system of exploitation is to curtail it across the board. We have more than enough factories as it is. We will cut production down to what we truly need, and get rid of all unnecessary assembly lines and projects, at least until we figure out a way to somehow make them sustainable."
ATM_dissolve_paladin_hierarchy_desc: "In the Brotherhood, earning the title of Paladin was perhaps the highest achievement in an officer's career. And yet, none knew precisely what that rank meant. Some served as field commanders, some as administrators, others even as simple guards. Though they may hold the same moniker, no two Paladins are of the same status. Maintaining such an uneven and unorganized structure of military leadership can only lead to further chaos, especially as we integrate our own units into it. Therefore, we must restore a tried-and-tested structure within the army, drawing from the traditional ranks of the once-mighty Polish armed forces as our basis. Unlike our enemies, we'll maintain a clear hierarchy with a well-defined chain of command and a fluid stream of promotion that will guarantee us a steady supply of both junior and senior officers, not just a bunch of lifelong appointees to the one exalted, all-encompassing position."
ATM_amnesty_for_officers_desc: "Not all of the generals we faced in our recent conflict are ideological fanatics. Some are simply spineless sellswords, willing to offer their services to anyone as long as it furthers their careers and brings a healthy stream of funds back into their pockets. While normally we'd steer clear of such snakes, regrettably, our army does suffer from a lack of higher leadership. We don't have nearly enough time to train our own loyal cadres, leaving us with only one option - take in the officers willing to fight for our cause, or rather coin. We'll heavily peer through their resumes, and make them swear oaths to fight for the glory of Atom, but ultimately, their loyalty is like a pennant in the wind - it turns in whatever direction fate currently blows. If we ever fall on hard times, they'll abandon us without a second thought."
ATM_nucleation_desc: "Now that we've got the foundation set, it's time to start adopting our new structure. Setting up a functional military administration from scratch is no easy task, especially when you also have to clean up someone else's mess at the same time. With our meager resources and in record time, we need to set up a central command, establish garrison posts across the entire region, and build training centers to prepare for the influx of new recruits. The task ahead seems herculean, but at least we don't have to face it alone. Some of the former Brotherhood officers under our employ have at least a basic understanding of how such a system should function. This is their chance to prove their worth."
ATM_long_road_to_normality_desc: "Let there be no doubt. We are deeply indebted to our partisans. They've proven their worth in battle beyond all expectations, but regrettably, untrained guerilla formations are not a scalable model fit for established states like ours. The absence of regulation is one thing, but the main issue is the lack of any standardized training regimen. In our last war, we often had to resort to sending anyone who knew how to shoot straight into combat. It's only through sheer luck and enemy incompetence that our forces pulled through. Things won't be so easy from now on. We're up against established regimes, often backed by remnants of the once-fiersome Army. If we're to stand against them, we'll need our troops thoroughly drilled to the highest standards. No more slacking off. There's war on the horizon, and this time we'll be prepared."
ATM_stop_ridiculous_army_programs_desc: "Wonder weapons - eye candy of dictators, vain representations of their fetishization of power. Given the Brotherhood's megalomanic aspirations, it's no wonder they wasted a large chunk of their budget on impractical, unachievable projects that would supposedly lay waste to their enemies. Multiple industrial complexes operated for that reason alone, wasting copious amounts of manpower and resources constructing unusable junk that now litters their warehouses. From now on, all such vanity projects will be halted, and all failed prototypes scrapped for parts. We don't expect to find anything useful, but in our situation, every loose cog matters. Once the trash has been cleared out, we'll repurpose the assembly lines to produce materials that could actually boost both our war effort and the population's well-being, no longer chasing impossible dreams of unmatched power. It's time for some responsibility around here."
ATM_brother_gadomski_desc: "Paladin Gadomski is a snake, an opportunist, willing to betray all he holds dear to save his position. He held no love for the Brotherhood's dogma, and he jumped ship as soon as any real danger arose. Normally, we'd steer clear of such untrustworthy individuals, but the sad truth is - we have no other choice. Out of the handful of paladins willing to cooperate with us to any degree, none knows the inner workings of the Brotherhood quite like Gadomski. Whether we like it or not, we need his expertise to refit its industrial machine and get everything up and running again. Luckily, the spineless coward has already ingratiated himself with much of our higher leadership by aiding us in the struggle against his former colleagues. Therefore, the plan is simple - a slap on the wrist to appease the masses and a cushy position once the sentence concludes."
ATM_redemption_for_civilian_sector_desc: "Having inherited the region from our former foes, we are inevitably forced to make do with whatever industry they deemed fit to leave us. Normally, we'd appreciate being able to build upon an already-functional system, but the Brotherhood's civilian sector is simply irredeemable. The few little embers of independent economic activity that remain exist only to fuel the suicidal system of resource exploitation and keep the population servile and dependent on the meager services provided. To break the disastrous cycle we need a complete refit, and for that - the expertise of someone who helped bring about this system in the first place. Gadomski does not deserve our attention, but he might just be our only chance to fix this mess. If he can find a way to turn the situation around, we might be lenient enough to grant him redemption."
ATM_repopulate_the_countryside_desc: "All over the region, empty houses dot the landscape, slowly decaying without their rightful owners. Under Ziemkiewicz's regime, thousands have been forcefully estranged from their countryside homes to feed the Brotherhood's industrial regime, and now that sanity has prevailed, it's time for them to finally return. Whether by their own means or with our help, the people will be reunited with their former possessions, allowing them to once more embrace their traditional ways of life. Though the fields they once toiled have most likely been dug up and left desecrated in search of any natural resources beneath, we'll give them whatever subsidies they need to get back on their feet. It's the least we can do for them after all the pain they've endured."
ATM_fight_the_smog_desc: "Though the Brotherhood's mad pursuit of industrial expansion at all costs has been violently halted, a relic of their ways persists in the very air we breathe. One can hardly exit their apartment without choking on the leftover smog, haunting us like a specter of our past sins against the environment. If we fail to quickly root it out, the damage might become permanent, forever turning central Poland into an uninhabitable wasteland. No matter how many resources it will take, we must remove this lingering poison so that one day, the sun's rays may once again shine over Bełchatów, free from deadly clouds that confine the city to darkness."
ATM_revitalize_agrarian_industry_desc: "After years of misuse, chemical pollution, and near-constant warfare, the once-fertile fields of our region have largely turned bare.  The few plots that weathered the harsh conditions have since been destroyed to make way for further industrial expansion. Thanks to the Brotherhood's lack of foresight, or rather its complete indifference toward the plight of its starving population, we're left with solitary, scattered patches of arable farmland on the outskirts of the voivodeship, where the machinery had yet to reach. As dire as the situation may seem, however, not all is lost. The most resilient strains have adapted to the unwelcoming climate. If we manage to plant their seeds across our territory, some may yet bear fruit. We'll use whatever spare funds we have to subsidize the ailing farmers and help them cultivate what remains of their lands. Hopefully, in time, they'll be able to support themselves once more."
ATM_green_is_back_on_menu_desc: "Though we've managed to restore a somewhat steady supply of fruits and vegetables to our markets, it seems we're faced with yet another problem - the lack of any actual demand. After years of anti-vegetarian propaganda, the people of Łódzkie have come to treat any natural products as outright harmful, ascribing all sorts of made-up health risks and conditions to even the simplest of plants. As ridiculous as it may sound, we need to go back to the drawing board and dispel these harmful myths, incentivizing the consumption of vegetables at all costs, even at a significant loss to our coffers. Our people are like toddlers, throwing a fit against the flavors they've come to forget. Just like their parents taught them to love plant-based food once, so too will we educate them to enjoy it again."
ATM_brother_janecki_desc: "Few names evoke as much fear within our ranks as that of Paladin Janecki. The grey eminence of the Brotherhood has long wreaked havoc among our sympathizers, meticulously picking us off one by one like a hunter silently stalking his prey. While we may have broken the shackles of his influence, the distrust sown by his infiltrators permeates our structure until this very day. Now that all his dark machinations have fallen through and he stands trial for his numerous crimes, the shadow no longer looms so large, reduced to a pitiful, powerless visage. Still, voices of those who lost family, friends, and comrades to Janecki's vicious persecutions clamor for their oppressor's death, demanding vengeance regardless of the rule of law. But can they be blamed? What mercy can there possibly be for such a monster?"
ATM_proctor_secret_files_desc: "A figure such as Janecki does not stay in power through the goodwill of his superiors alone. There was little reason for anyone in the Brotherhood's highest circles to trust him, yet fewer to not replace him with someone more loyal and predictable. There can be only one explanation. They feared opposing him, and for that to be the case, the damn spider needed to have dirt on everyone worth their salt. He must have written it all down somewhere. If we can get our hands on this information, we could easily keep his former colleagues in check. Besides, he might have even gone far enough to have something damning on our own leadership. It's better to be safe than sorry. We'll search through all his leftover possessions, leaving no stone unturned. If he has the files stashed away somewhere, we will eventually find them. Better us than our enemies."
ATM_secret_service_apparatus_desc: "While the Brotherhood's legacy is largely that of failure, there is one thing we have to give to them - they knew how to keep dissidents, both domestic and foreign, in check. Janecki was no fool. The organization he established is a spy's wet dream, able to wriggle its tendrils into the tiniest of cracks in search of any unrest. In the ever-shifting political landscape of post-Fall Poland, where loyalties often change on a whim, we'd be wise to repurpose the agency to suit our needs. Of course, we don't strive for nearly the same level of brutality and terror as the former director, but it still wouldn't hurt appropriating some of his more effective methods of control. Some may call us hypocritical, some may turn their backs on us, but while resuming the invasive campaign of state-sponsored invigilation won't get us any allies, it will ensure something far more important - survival."
ATM_cleanse_the_ranks_desc: "Though our efforts to repurpose the Brotherhood’s secret services have thus far yielded acceptable results, it seems the ideological rot Janecki instilled into every level of his beloved organization goes deeper than we could have possibly predicted. From the lowest clerks to the highest officers, this infection has reached all, turning them into sleeper agents against our cause. While they may diligently perform their tasks for now, who knows what sort of dirt they’re digging up on our leaders behind their backs, like a hornets' nest of traitors just waiting to be stirred? There can be no half-measures. This growing tumor will be excised before they have a chance to strike, even if it means replacing the entire agency with untrained loyalists."
ATM_stop_the_persecutions_desc: "After many years under the Brotherhood's jackboot, the people of Łódzkie have learned one emotion - fear. Janecki's network of spies dug deep, violently exposing the slightest traces of dissent or even doubt in the enforced doctrine. A cruel fate awaited those who dared speak up, as sometimes just a couple of poorly framed words over family dinners became grounds for a person's swift termination. And while a certain degree of order must be maintained, we cannot let such a brutal policy continue, not after it resulted in the deaths of so many of our ecologist comrades. We will do the right thing and loosen the reins so the persecuted dissidents will at last be able to come out of hiding. The dark clouds of tyranny are about to be dispelled."
ATM_bring_the_dissidents_desc: "Despite the Brotherhood portraying itself as an ideological monolith, it seems not all of its former members are beyond reproach. Aside from a large contingent of ideologues unceremoniously shunned for their opposition to the organization's radical turn, it seems even within the established ranks, a full-blown reformist wing took hold, spearheaded by the youthful passion and pragmatism of the coal cult's newest generation. They may not agree with us completely, but their knowledge of this government's inner workings might prove indispensable in our quest to undo its most harmful policies. It's a shot in the dark, but it's better than doing nothing. Regardless of our opinions, we should at least make some diplomatic overtures to see if a partnership is at all possible. We'd rather have them on our side than face Europe's largest environmental crisis on our own."
ATM_greenpeace_poland_desc: "Few organizations have a reputation as controversial as Greenpeace. In many ways, their ideals contradict ours, and their opposition to nuclear energy has long been a thorn in the side of any legitimate environmental movement. Even now, we don't expect them to hold much love for our ideas on how to handle the crises at hand. Some may call it foolish to empower an organization so vehemently opposed to our state's core vision, but in our fight to stave off doomsday, we need all hands on deck. Surely, the activists will appreciate being able to finally come out of hiding, free from persecution, and given a near-blank cheque to resume their climate advocacy. They can grumble about our nuclear dreams internally all they want as long as they stay in their lane and don't interfere. It shouldn't be that hard to keep them in line. After all, they do owe us greatly."
ATM_promise_of_atom_desc: "As we languished in the bombed-out hellscape of Bałuty, one vision, one goal heartened us in our struggle, gave us purpose, and a reason to keep fighting - the dream of an atomic Poland. Now that we stand as the undisputed masters of Łódzkie, there is nothing that our supporters await more than the fulfillment of this dream. We've kept the people in the dark long enough. It is time to reaffirm our commitment to our movement's foundational idea. It is time to start building our first reactor. While we have nary the resources nor the expertise, our situation simply does not afford us the ability to delay the project ad infinitum. If we wish to maintain any sense of accountability, we have to immediately start drawing up the plans for our megaproject's construction, even if actually pulling it off will strain us up to the breaking point. So, let's make our ambitions official and let fate bind us. Whether we succeed or not, this shall be our legacy."
ATM_reform_crusaders_desc: "The Crusaders have served us well. Their numerous acts of bravery and heroism will forever be remembered; enshrined and cherished in the stories of our improbable victory. And yet, as we widen our scope of operations, it becomes evident that their current structure is simply not up to the task. If we are to reunify the country, we will need a proper, modern army, not just poorly regulated partisans. To that end, to ensure appropriate discipline, doctrine, and training, we will officially induct the militias into our newly professionalized armed forces, turning them into the true vanguard of the atomic crusade. Sure, with the new standards, we might have to sort the wheat from the chaff, but with the near-endless stream of volunteers, we expect the transition to be nothing but seamless."
ATM_great_reduction_plan_desc: "Humanity can be a wasteful race, a parasite upon the planet, draining it of all resources and burning it through greenhouse gasses until, eventually, all life on the surface perishes. Our own actions have left our days numbered as we continue to reverse terraform the Earth, ignorant of our impending demise. The time for milquetoast responses and toothless speeches has long passed, so if mankind is to be saved, we have to take drastic action. From now on, on any land our soldiers reach, the carbon footprint shall be annihilated, reduced to zero until the whole country is at last ecologically sustainable. We're bound to ruffle plenty of feathers and will, at times, have to shoot ourselves in the foot by destroying crucial industries, but we're facing extinction and survival is non-negotiable."
ATM_free_ecologists_desc: "Though we've endured plenty of hardships, cowering for survival in the irradiated ruins of Bałuty, let there be no doubt - we are the lucky few. While we eked out a rudimentary existence among this harsh reality, our brethren toiled in the dark depths of the Bełchatów mines, without any breaks, away from the sunlight, dehumanized, until their bodies gave in and the shafts became their graves. To this day, plenty of our sympathizers remain shackled in these horrid conditions, unaware of the change that happened above. They work to feed a machine long out of order, in fear that if they ever stop, an undertaker will swiftly deliver their punishment. Their sentences are finally over, and we will free them and return them to the surface so they may at last rejoin society. If their minds haven't yet been broken, that is."
ATM_pentomic_battle_groups_desc: "Ever since the start of the atomic age, war has changed. With a new, all-powerful weapon looming over the combatants, capable of wiping out entire divisions with a single strike, slow, meticulous advances, and permanent positions have become a thing of the past. If we're to break through enemy lines before being annihilated by the power of the Atom, we have to fundamentally reform the structure of our armed forces, giving each battalion enough specialized equipment to conduct offensive operations on its own, without the need to depend on the support of other formations. That way, we'll be able to attack quickly, overwhelming our foes and dispersing before they can even consider a nuclear response. Stuck with their antiquated tactics, our enemies will be rendered helpless, left at the mercy of our spearheads."
ATM_message_from_berlin_desc: "Our recent success has undoubtedly resulted in increased notoriety, even outside Poland's borders. Many regard us with cautious optimism as a welcome change and our victory as one of the rare few positive stories emerging from the war-torn region. Some brave souls even attempted to pitch in for our noble cause. Yet, among this stream of reactions, a deafening silence persists - that of the Germans, the self-proclaimed 'Masters of Europe.' With their wealth of resources and interventionist policy, their opposition could singlehandedly crush all we have ever achieved. We expect no love from them; mere begrudging tolerance of our ascent would be more than enough. We already have plenty of enemies at home; we don't need to add another to the list. We can only hope they share this sentiment."
ATM_clearer_sky_desc: "For the first time in nearly a decade, the sun breaks through the clouds of smog. While the urban centers will likely continue to suffer for years to come, life on the periphery is slowly starting to once more feel almost... normal. The constant deafening churning of industrial machinery has given way to the peaceful hum of tractors, working diligently to prepare for the first harvest in a region reborn. Though the yields will likely be barely enough to provide basic sustenance, it is a sign of a new era nonetheless - as water squeezed from a stone, the building blocks of life scraped from a barren land. We have weathered the toughest of seasons, ensured our continued survival, and laid the groundwork for nature's slow revival. From behind the thick shroud that obscures us from the world, a faint glimmer now shines - a hope we've fully earned."
ATM_shadow_of_chernobyl_desc: "In 1986, on the 26th of April, the atomic cause within Poland died, presumably permanently. As the fateful reactor burned, spewing radiation all over Eastern Europe, waves of fear spread across our country, instilling a lifelong phobia of anything nuclear in the terrified population. Back then, few could have predicted the extent of this distrust, lasting for generations until Poland was eventually left on the wayside, addicted to coal. Since the catastrophe that defined the last decades of our energy mix, safety standards have largely gone up, and outputs have spiked, making it clear that nuclear energy is the only path forward in ending our reliance on fossil fuels. And yet, the people, still shell-shocked after the tragedy in Chernobyl tremble at the mere mention of our grand plans, sabotage our efforts, paint us as devils, evil agents who wish to bring forth another such disaster. In their hearts, that tragic day still lives on. If we're to go forward with the construction of our first reactor, we must find a way to ease their worries, lest we end up having to face the desperate masses head-on."
ATM_fallout_desc: "We've come a long way since our takeover of Łódzkie. What started as a barely noteworthy resistance group has since grown into one of the main contenders for Poland's reunification. Against all odds, we largely contained the damage caused by our predecessors and restored a semblance of harmony to a ruined region. Of course, now is not the time to rest on our laurels. We're still far from reaching our targets, and there are plenty of challenges on our way. The environment has yet to heal, the people rally against our policies, and foreign hawks prepare to strike when we least expect it. And yet, there is one thing we can celebrate. We're no longer just the cleanup crew, defined by our struggle against the Brotherhood's lingering legacy. From now on, our challenges, successes, and failures are our own. We have become the masters of our fate."

ATM_prepare_for_future_desc: "We've waited long enough. No matter the challenges we face, we cannot remain blind to our greater purpose. The entire idea of the Atomic Crusade centered around one fundamental promise - to construct a nuclear reactor on Polish soil and bring us out of the smog-filled, coal-dependent days. Now it's time to deliver upon those words. In the past months, we've consistently been setting funds aside to jumpstart the project. All we need is to decide on the direction - we can either follow conventional nuclear adaptations and construct one massive reactor to supply the entire country or go for the far riskier solution of establishing a decentralized network of local SMR reactors. Both solutions possess multiple strengths, but ultimately, only one can prevail. It's up to Wiech to decide."
ATM_revive_smr_project_desc: "While simply constructing one massive reactor might seem like the conventional choice, the recent setbacks in worldwide nuclear development have made smaller, safer alternatives far more tenable, especially given our current... fragile economic situation. We can't expect nearly the same output as traditional models, but the heavily reduced price tag more than makes up for the need to build several dispersed units to meet the needs of our expanding power grid. As the project has already been tried by a handful of companies, making good headway before being rapidly cut off by the Fall, we have enough data to prove that it can be successful in a local setting. If properly placed at crucial hubs of the energy network, SMR reactors could provide us with a far more uniform distribution of nuclear power, with the added benefit of increased scalability. In truth, it's the only rational choice."
ATM_korean_khnp_desc: "The Korean state-owned KHNP is perhaps the most experienced of our potential partners, responsible for numerous large-scale projects all around the globe. They do come with one crucial flaw, however. Their name is primarily associated with traditional reactors, and thus far, the company has mostly considered SMRs as an afterthought, overshadowed by their usual ventures, leading to concerns about whether they possess the technological edge required to deliver the quality we demand. Yet, the company has repeatedly proven its reliability and cost-effectiveness and has since shifted its focus in a way that aligns with our needs. It might be a shot in the dark, but KHNP seems to be the best option when it comes to expertise, with the added benefit of no existing ties to any of our competitors. We can't expect anything too flashy, just a whole lot of dependable work - the safest bet to actually complete the project."
ATM_american_nuscale_desc: "The ambitions of NuScale are clear. The company has repeatedly stated its focus on energetic safety, placing the struggle against climate change and the need to transition to renewable sources as its guiding principle. Through their deal with the KGHM, they have already demonstrated their interest in our market, undeterred even by the risk such investment would entail given Poland's shifting landscape. Recently, they have once again started looking for business opportunities, and no state can offer them a better partnership than ours. Whether their lofty claims of working to save the environment through their operations are true or merely an overembellished sales pitch is, as with all companies, unclear, but even if they're merely paying lip service to our principles, NuScale is still the best choice to further our mission."
ATM_japanese_hitachi_desc: "The Nuclear Energy Department of the Hitachi megacorporation makes no pretenses about its true intentions - they're in it for the money. They've approached Polish enterprises before, striking a deal with Orlen to develop SMR reactors on our soil, but, as with all promising projects, their efforts were interrupted by the country's dissolution. They'll likely have apprehensions about dipping into our market once more, but with the right guarantees and promises to refund their investments should anything go awry, we might be able to get them to the negotiating table. They're greedy, soulless vultures, but when it comes to getting the bang for our buck it likely won't be possible to find a better partner anywhere. Sometimes you have to set your principles aside and go with the pragmatic option. Hitachi can give us the best deal, and that's all that matters."
ATM_envoy_to_plock_desc: "Nothing exemplifies the controversial nature of PKN Orlen better than the figure of its long-serving chairman. Though he has turned the company from just another semi-notable enterprise into a relatively prospering, self-sufficient state, it's tough to say whether Obajtek has his heart in the right place or if his actions are merely a byproduct of his constant scheme for personal advancement. He is, at best, unreliable, a turncoat who abandoned the man he owes his whole career to in his greatest time of need. And yet, he's also probably the only warlord in the entire country willing to work with us. He's been receptive to nuclear technology before, at least when it suited him. If we give him the recognition he wants, perhaps a cushy job once the country is back whole, he might be willing to settle. It beats having to send our divisions against him, that's for sure."
ATM_envoy_to_lubin_desc: "KGHM has frequently labeled itself as a largely progressive corporation, refusing to shirk responsibility when it comes to environmental matters even when its competitors employed numerous cutthroat business practices. Their implementation of eco-effective and low-emission technologies is commendable, as are their attempts to introduce SMR reactors to cover their energetic needs. Following the Fall of the Eurokommissariats, KGHM has been able to eke out its own little state in the country's Southwestern corner, defiantly standing alone against the German tide. The company is certainly worth our attention, and its relatively harmonious alignment with our ideals presents a unique opportunity to forge a lasting pact for our combined advancement. Should they deem it fit to cooperate with us, we'll be able to approach the coming wars as a unified force, for which rewarding their board members with high-ranking positions in our administration once all is said and done is a relatively small price to pay."
ATM_location_plans_desc: "One of the main benefits of implementing SMR technology is the ability to build multiple smaller reactors in all corners of our territory. Though the sky's the limit when it comes to just how many we can place, and the near-constant flurry of increasingly ambitious proposals sounds more like a bidding war than a rational decision process, our current funds permit the construction of no more than 3 units, at least for the time being. Even with such a massive investment, we can't expect to cover the entirety of our energy grid, but this initial overture should greatly reduce the strain on our existing network, allowing for the possibility of further development. We have to start somewhere, and to get going, we must first decide upon the placement of our reactors from among the countless locations tirelessly suggested by our advisors."
ATM_dabrowa_gornicza_desc: "The decision process for the placement of our initial SMR reactors was a long and drawn-out affair, but ultimately, the stipulations of the Great Reduction Plan necessitate that we pool our resources into the city of Dąbrowa Górnicza. While its strategic placement on the eastern axis of the Katowice metropolis provides sufficient grounds for development in and of itself, another reason makes focusing on it a no-brainer. A far greater structure dominates the area than the one we wish to place; a structure we'd love to see heavily reshaped in our image. Huta Katowice is a nationwide metallurgical giant, but the power plants supplying it are titans of pollution. To justify taking action to radically transform the Combinate, the least we could do is give the people something they can cherish in return. Our actions are bound to heavily disturb the local industrial ecosystem, but in the long run, the citizens of Dąbrowa Górnicza will hopefully be able to find a new sense of pride as part of Poland's atomic vanguard."
ATM_oswiecim_desc: "Nowa Huta has already been considered as a potential nuclear development site by past administrations. The proximity to one of Poland's largest urban centers and academic bases allows it, given sufficient funding, to one day serve as a major atomic hub, making it the perfect location to place one of our first SMR reactors. Additionally, the heat generated by the reactor would provide us with the unique possibility to put the nearby CHP plant out of use, effectively neutralizing one of the country's largest polluters. As nearly all assets in PGE's portfolio, the structure has long been a thorn in the side of every ecologist, yet its crucial position has thus far prevented all attempts to hamper its continued function. Until now. We'll kill two birds with one stone and give the station its overdue retirement."
ATM_ostroleka_desc: "The Ostrołęka Power Plant is a nearly one-hundred-year-old colossus, supplying the whole region with dirt-cheap energy, but it has since outlived its usefulness despite the former government's attempts to expand its operations. Each day, the plant spews copious amounts of pollutants into the atmosphere, and thus, in alignment with the Reduction Plan, it has to be replaced by a more sustainable alternative - a nuclear reactor. During the construction, we can start slowly phasing out the station's units until the eventual closure upon our project's completion. Due to the complex's current high output, substituting its production will require a near-total focus on generating as much power as can be safely acquired, but if we manage to properly implement the newest technological solutions, we should be able to end up with an overall surplus."
ATM_prepare_huta_katowice_desc: "The industrial behemoth of Huta Katowice has a long history of change. Once, it served as one of the main centers of Solidarność, and ever since, it has come to be that every ideological change of guard within Poland leaves its personal mark on the steelworks. We can't be any worse, of course, and to solidify our presence, our imprint will go even farther than those of past regimes. The complex is a relic of the past, especially in the matter of emissions. It's high time we bring it into the 21st century by transitioning it in accordance with contemporary practices. As we make space for our SMR reactor, we'll equip the plant with modernized carbon dioxide filters, employ rigid safety protocols, and provide housing for the workers so that 'Huta' can evolve into a symbol of our movement."
ATM_prepare_monowice_ponds_desc: "To this day, the Combinate towers over the district of Nowa Huta, defining its reputation as Poland's steel basin. Yet, it could be so much more. The placement of an SMR reactor in the area affords us the unique opportunity to give the entire complex a fundamental facelift. We can utilize the vast empty swathes of untamed greenery to the factory's east as the location for Poland's largest solar farm, while the immediate surroundings could be turned into a modern technical park. As a top-of-the-line communalized hub for entrepreneurs and industrial thinkers, the area will facilitate the flow of information between the various leading branches of R&D. Nowa Huta has long existed in Kraków's shadow. From now on, the peripheral district will hold the atomic crown."
ATM_seize_the_land_desc: "Our plan to replace the outdated power plant has but one crucial hindrance - both the complex itself, as well as the land that surrounds it lie in private hands. We don't expect the current owners to be particularly enthusiastic about their primary moneymaker's imminent closure, and thus, only one avenue seems open in the face of their stark rejection to sell - forced nationalization. Luckily for us, we have sufficient grounds to seize the property via eminent domain, citing the stipulations of the Great Reduction Plan. In one swift move, we'll come in and take ownership before they can mount any opposition. Of course, we'll offer them some paltry compensation in the process. We're not heartless, after all. If that's not enough, we'll argue our case in some friendly court. The crucial thing is that we'll be able to immediately get to work - install some carbon filters to limit pollution and slowly scale down production."
ATM_specialists_from_abroad_desc: "Our local cadres are... underwhelming, to say the least. Normally, that'd be something you could easily smooth out given enough time, but a nuclear reactor isn't really an appropriate site for on-the-job training. Rather than have our workers scurrying around like blind mice just waiting for a disaster to happen, it might just be a tad bit more rational to hire someone with actual experience. Fortunately, foreign nuclear experts are in quite a high supply thanks to our neighbors' brilliant decision to completely abandon all of their existing power plants. It won't hurt poaching a few specialists from further out as well. Once we've contracted a sufficiently knowledgeable manpower pool, we can use them not just to keep our reactors running but to also give additional lectures to our... not-so-bright hirelings. Maybe if they explain the main aspects slowly and simply enough, at least some of the lessons will stick."
ATM_conversion_of_belchatow_desc: "When it comes to our energy requirements, the choice is clear - go big or go home. We have Poland's largest power plant right in the middle of our territory. Currently, it's also the country's main polluter, but that is about to change drastically. Ziemkiewicz and his old pals will be seething in rage seeing their crown jewel transformed into the leading producer of clean energy, but that is precisely what we shall do. We'll take the massive Bełchatów power station, dismantle its current, wasteful form, and replace it with a colossal nuclear reactor that will cover our energy needs for generations. It will be costly and will likely require a delicate balance to avoid another blackout, but if we actually manage to pull it off, we'll not only secure our energy independence but also destroy the proudest emblem of the Brotherhood's legacy."
ATM_partial_shutdown_desc: "The Bełchatów Power Station remains the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in all of Europe, a black mark on our ecological resume that discredits our claims of rapidly approaching a net zero reality for as long as it operates. Though the structure was heavily damaged during the initial stages of our Atomic Crusade, we've managed to do little to halt the constant industrial churn. Just as coal burned in the furnaces under Ziemkiewicz's reign, so too does it burn under ours. To break out of this cycle of hypocrisy, where we speak out against fossil fuels but keep using them to sustain ourselves, we'll progressively shut down production in the barely functioning blocks that were most harmed during the conflict. It shouldn't disrupt our energy balance too much and will open the window to alternative developments. As we slowly dismantle Bełchatów, we fully expect alternative energy sources to pick up the slack."
ATM_energy_balance_desc: "It sounds great, doesn't it? Just shut down fossil fuel usage, wait until nuclear energy picks up the slack, and enjoy our new, fully sustainable system. Oh, it turns out we've apparently just invented the recipe for a shutdown. There's no way around it. The only way to scale down our reliance on coal is through a slow, gradual drift, coupled with the expansion of renewable energy sources for a balanced energy mix. It's going to be a long process, but day by day, factory by factory, we'll push ever closer to breaking Poland's unhealthy dependence. The atomic era will come, but we won't reach it without first doing all the work, otherwise, it will burn up in our hands before we ever see its advent."
ATM_security_measures_desc: "The issue of atomic safety isn't something to be scoffed at. Even though the overly sensationalist claims repeatedly spouted by our detractors that make it seem like the moment we turn on the first reactor, the entire country will turn into one giant irradiated wasteland, hold little weight, we'd be wise to implement numerous protective measures regardless. To minimize the risks posed by radioactive materials, we shall follow the highest global standards, supplying our workers with appropriate shielding gear, utilizing comprehensive safety nets to prevent the possibility of a single error breaking the entire system, and carefully setting up our storage and waste management chains to keep dangerous materials as far removed from human contact as possible. The Atom's detractors are looking for even the tiniest slip-up to justify their fear. We will not give them the reason they crave."
ATM_national_atomic_agency_desc: "Even the best-laid plans are bound to go awry without proper oversight. While we can certainly watch over the construction process, we can't afford to have our attention constantly divided in the face of other challenges. What we need is a trusted organization dedicated to the purpose of ensuring the appropriate maintenance and development of nuclear systems, free to autonomously intervene should things ever stray from the desired standard. Taking its pre-Fall counterpart as a model, we will set up an agency made up of experts in the field of atomics, which shall preside over the function of the Bełchatów reactor, as well as all other future ventures, so that for once in our country's history, the relevant decisions will be made by people with some actual knowledge and experience."
ATM_infrastructure_issues_desc: "To maintain an efficient supply chain and prevent bottlenecks, the current road network around the Bełchatów area will require a fundamental restructuring. One-lane provincial tracts may be enough for civilian usage, but attempting to run cargo trucks on the pothole-ridden streets is bound to lead to nothing but trouble. To prevent massive traffic jams crippling every single delivery, we'll handle the matter decisively, constructing a set of highways, railway lines, and other crucial infrastructure that will transform Bełchatów into a central hub for all industrial activity. Besides the obvious effect of securing our planned power plant's uninterrupted functionality, the investment is bound to serve as a powerful boost to the entire region, decisively elevating its economic potential to rival even those of the country's largest metropolises, and earning us the favor of its residents."
ATM_restructurization_of_belchatow_desc: "The city of Bełchatów is as out of date as the idea it has come to represent. Changing its identity will require far more than just placing a massive megastructure at its center and calling it a day. To cleanse the stain left by the Brotherhood, the entire urban core will have to be remodeled and redesigned in our image. From the cramped streets, through the soulless monuments to 'progress,' all the way to the tangled web of piping running under this entire mess, we'll refit every brick so this once-capital of coal can truly become the new nexus of atomic power. Under our watch, the city shall turn into a metropolis fully aligned with the needs of the monumental nuclear power plant that will overlook it, growing in its shadow as the exemplary model of a new age."
ATM_old_government_documents_desc: "The idea of building a nuclear reactor on Poland's territory isn't anything new. In fact, even if one were to look over fifty years back, before the days the idea was tainted for future generations by a series of disasters, our former eastern overlords made numerous overtures to expand their nuclear ambitions onto our lands. As with most Soviet plans, the construction ended up being a catastrophic, embarrassing failure, yet they did leave behind a series of invaluable documents - detailed building plans, precise measurements, predicted output, required supply projections... nearly all the data we'd need to conduct our own attempt at establishing a nuclear power plant, if not for the fact that most of it is riddled with errors and oversights. That doesn't mean it's useless, however. The documents are a treasure trove of advice, as their shortcomings detail everything not to do if we wish for our project to succeed. We just kind of need to... do the exact opposite of what they suggest at times."
ATM_experiences_of_zarnowiec_desc: "The unfinished Żarnowiec power plan is the closest our country came to building a functioning nuclear reactor. We were a hair's length away from joining the prestigious ranks of the world's atom-harnessing powers, but, in the most crucial moment of Poland's ideological transition, our short-sighted government decided to scrap the whole project, claiming it to be 'redundant for the nation's internal energy balance.' Nowadays, the half-built ruins of the Żarnowiec complex remind us of what could have been, the precious time we lost, and of our self-inflicted coal dependency. Of course, the Cold War era technology used in the construction was dangerous even by the standards of those olden days, and it'd be prudent to steer clear of many of the unsafe cost-cutting solutions used to try pushing the project through, but we can still draw plenty of lessons from this failed attempt to tame the Atom's power."
ATM_water_problems_desc: "Setting up a chain of fission reactions is one thing; keeping it under control is a whole different challenge. To avoid an endless feedback loop that ends with the entire building up in smoke, we're going to need a constant supply of the universal coolant - water. It sounds so trivial to just utilize some local lake and drain it for every drop, but the Bełchatów region isn't exactly blessed with any reservoir of sufficient volume. In the absence of readymade solutions, we have no choice but to think outside the box. For now, we can bring some from outside, one truck at a time if needed. It's a good start, but it won't cut it in the long run. One day something's bound to go wrong, and the coolant won't reach its destination on time. We'll have to come up with something more permanent..."
ATM_belchatow_mines_reservoirs_desc: "One of the few benefits provided by the Fall is the sheer number of outlandish ideas conceived by the flocks of unchained ideologues. Most of them are utterly worthless and best left forgotten, but on a rare occasion, a gem can be found among the garbage heaps. A long time ago, we discovered some barely legible, madly scribbled plans among Sapkowski's notes, and the madman... actually made some sense for once, though for all the wrong reasons. While his idea to flood the Bełchatów mines was likely borne out of sheer delirium, we can utilize it to create a massive underground reservoir that will serve as a source of fresh water for the cooling of our reactor. Covering the whole network of shafts will be a massive undertaking, but if we start irrigating this soon-to-be lake now, we should be mostly done by the time we'll require its usage."
ATM_begin_staff_training_desc: "The local workforce severely lacks the know-how necessary to turn our magnum opus from a mere series of architectural drawings into an actual free-standing, functional structure, much less run the thing once it's operational. We know full well that if we give them the green light now, they'll completely screw the construction up, leaving behind a mess that will require extensive maintenance from the moment the builders put the finishing touches on it. Sloppily done work, the lack of any discipline, crews showing up late, unmotivated, or drunk... that will be the norm unless we curtail such excesses in advance. It's embarrassing to have to delay due to such a matter, but if we want the job done right, we'll have to heavily ramp up personnel training in preparation for the next stages of the project."
ATM_engineers_from_maria_reactor_desc: "Many fail to recognize that a nuclear reactor on Polish soil wouldn't be anything new. In fact, even before the Fall, a small plant existed in the nation's capital, although it focused primarily on research purposes rather than energy generation. The anti-atomic fury of the Wawer anarchists may have irreparably destroyed Maria, but it could only go so far. The engineers have fled, taking their expertise with them. Despite being a decade out of work, their knowledge is still invaluable, and undoubtedly, many should be happy to return to their field of specialty after years of unending toil. We'll offer them the most lucrative contracts of their lives to bring them to our side so that once we begin operations in earnest, the safety of our reactor won't have to depend on a bunch of untrained brutes."
ATM_our_own_grand_project_desc: "The Brotherhood loved to claim Bełchatów as their own creation, and indeed, no place exemplified their corruption better than the smog-ridden city. Today, Bełchatów presents a far different image - the staunch defender of coal has become the herald of a nuclear era. Our work has been monumental, but all our past efforts have been nothing but preparations for the construction of our magnum opus. We stand ready to leave a permanent mark on Polish history, achieved through the dedication and devotion of atomic hearts. We can pat ourselves on the back. We've everything to get our first megaproject right, even when life kept throwing obstacles in our way. The sight of our greatest achievement will fill our souls with pride."
ATM_phase_construction_desc: "All the preparatory work has been completed, and we're ready to break ground on the monumental construction endeavor that awaits us. Months of planning, desperate resource gathering, funds allocation - that was all the easy part. The real trial starts now. If we've done our job diligently thus far, we can likely expect steady progress over the expected building period. As the structure takes shape brick by brick, the next few years are bound to be filled with anticipation and excitement as we inch ever closer to the fulfillment of our atomic dreams. We can now focus on other matters, pat ourselves on the back, and watch with pride as our greatest project takes shape. We have set our sights on achieving the near-impossible, and despite the pervasive sense of doubt both internally and abroad, we are about to deliver on this most important promise."
ATM_foreign_workforce_desc: "Ask your typical Polish builder to fix you a leak, and you'll end up with half your house flooded. Ask him to construct you a house, and he'll make you a shanty. Ask him to build you a nuclear reactor, and the thing will likely blow up within a month of being put to use. We're all for using the local workforce, but in a matter this crucial, it might be better to hire someone who won't just do the bare minimum required for the paycheck. Numerous foreign companies have experience working on atomic power plants and, the reputation to back up their reliability. They'll be far costlier than local alternatives, but at least they won't fumble the entire project and embarrass us in front of the whole world. We've already paid so much, the additional pocket change will barely make a difference."
ATM_diverting_resources_idea_desc: "The construction has proven to be a massive undertaking, requiring even more funds than our initial estimations could have predicted. Despite exemplarily diligent accounting on our part, we are still significantly short on change, forcing us to delay payments and scale down the more costly sections to somehow fit everything into our tight budget. We're running on fumes, and therefore, the only way to avoid the project completely stalling is to funnel even more cash and resources down the money drain. Any surplus, any savings we could set aside without risking our nation's integrity, will be used to subsidize the growing reactor. Once it is complete, it will repay us in kind with near-free energy for the rest of our lives - a boon worth any price to receive."
ATM_focus_on_nuclear_shield_desc: "The international diplomatic situation isn't nearly as friendly as we've hoped. We live in a hostile world, and any attempts to challenge its entrenched hierarchy are sure to be met with retaliation from the powers afraid to lose their global standing. While the power plant remains our top priority, we might end up needing something far more... direct to guarantee our protection. In the event of a potential conflict with our German enemies, we could quickly witness warheads flying over our territory, and they most likely won't be aimed at Berlin, but rather seek to turn each of our cities into another Bałuty. To prevent the specter of complete desolation, we'll have to construct a nuclear shield to intercept any attempts to breach our airspace by foreign missiles. We need to ensure that even if they fire their entire arsenal, not a single one of them will ever reach its target."
ATM_question_of_uranium_desc: "To fuel a nuclear power plant one needs a steady supply of enriched uranium. The only problem? We don't have any. Unless we plan on magically generating electricity through the force of our ambitions alone, we must find a way to obtain access to reliable sources. Of course, when it comes to this precious resource, our core territory is completely barren. That doesn't mean we're totally out of luck, however. Reports from exploratory missions conducted before the Fall indicate untapped deposits on both extremities of our nation - in the mountains down south and the Lakelands up north. If we send out teams to locate appropriate digging sites, we could likely start the excavation process in no time. Should that prove too costly or difficult, there's always another option on the table - purchasing uranium from abroad. However, with our state struggling for any international recognition, finding any willing partners might prove to be beyond our capabilities."
ATM_import_proposals_desc: "When it comes to foreign partners, our options are fairly limited, but if we wish to kickstart our nuclear power plant's function, importing uranium will be necessary for the time being. Most markets are completely closed off to any potential ventures. After all, few wish to deal with the risk of selling a highly radioactive material, often used in nuclear warheads, to an unrecognized statelet embroiled in a civil war, surrounded on all sides by hostile warlords who could easily seize it for their own nefarious purposes. Some, however, care little about what happens to their goods as long as they get sufficiently paid. We could try throwing our money around to attract resource-rich third-world countries. If that fails, we might have to get on our knees and beg friendly powers to place their trust in our cause. If we've done enough to sway them thus far, they may, hopefully, acquiesce."
ATM_reach_western_contacts_desc: "Luckily for us, not all Western powers are as stuck up as the Germans. The French and Canadians have expressed interest in cooperating with us, and though they likely meant only diplomatic recognition and maybe a sprinkle of humanitarian aid, we have to find a way to convince them to dispense something far more important, and dangerous. While this avenue won't guarantee success, and we'll have to seriously strain our diplomatic corps to even stand a chance of receiving anything other than a strict condemnation, if we have our ambitions set on achieving any global legitimacy, we'll have to conduct ourselves like and deal only with the most respected nations. If we manage to portray ourselves as an up-and-coming alternative to German continental dominance, we might have some luck with their primary competitors."
ATM_pragmatic_deals_desc: "We've considered multiple international partners, narrowed the list down to the most promising two, but eventually, we're down to just one. The Canadians see no reason to trust us. They have no incentive to help a struggling wildcard on the other side of the globe, and they hardly need our cash either, not that we could really offer them that much. Our final hope lies with the French, who are willing to aid us for one simple purpose - it weakens the Germans. Since the Invasion, the two powers have been locked in a constant struggle for European dominance, and thus far, the scales have been firmly tipped in Berlin's favor. France is desperate, and they're looking for anyone to join their side. If they can prove to be a reliable supplier, we might open up an avenue towards further cooperation."
ATM_tap_into_african_business_desc: "Why turn to middlemen when we can get our much-needed resources straight from the source? Instead of dealing with the arrogant Western powers who wouldn't sell us an ounce unless it directly benefits them, we can negotiate far more acceptable prices from the African regimes that obtain uranium through their own means. Unlike their more developed counterparts, they won't be overly picky when it comes to choosing customers. It should be a simple affair - we get the goods, they get their compensation. If anything, we might actually expect a small dose of sympathy. Are we so different after all? We're both struggling governments desperately trying to keep our nations afloat in the face of countless insurgencies. A mutually beneficial cooperation should be in the interests of everyone concerned."
ATM_weapons_for_ore_desc: "Nothing comes for free, and there's only one universal currency in this world - guns. While we can drown our African allies in cash, flooding their markets with our unstable Złoty, it would be prudent to sweeten the deal with something slightly... controversial, but possessing far more bargaining power. Our stockpiles are overfilled with old post-soviet and makeshift post-Fall models. To us, they're worthless, but for a poverty-stricken nation without a single factory larger than a local workshop, dealing with a dozen insurgencies, three coups, and one countercoup, even our most antiquated pieces could be an invaluable lifeline. If we throw in some contraband as part of every shipment, we should easily be able to negotiate a steady stream of uranium for far below the market rate. In essence, it would almost be like getting it for free."
ATM_search_in_the_south_desc: "The southern deposits are relatively paltry when compared to their northern counterparts, but they do present one crucial benefit that makes attempting their exploitation worthwhile - they're by far easier to find and mine. Thanks to former excavations conducted during the early years of the People's Republic nearly a full century ago, the prime spots for uranium procurement have been thoroughly mapped out, complete with suggested locations for mine placement. Many of the most resource-rich areas have unfortunately long been stripped bare to fuel Soviet ambitions, but a good portion of the desired element remains untapped and waiting for our crews to unearth. Even accounting for the limits of our current technology, we should still be able to obtain enough to cover our needs for the foreseeable future."
ATM_sudety_deposits_desc: "The grim story of the Sudety uranium mines remains one of the darkest stains on the history of the oppressive People's Republic. Unbeknownst to the wider public, thousands of prisoners toiled against their will without any safety equipment. To this day, it remains unknown how many gave their lives in the cramped, dimly lit tunnels in which their bodies now remain for eternity. But even this tragedy has its silver lining. If anything, we should thank the old authorities. They've done our job for us. The empty mines have laid dormant for the past few decades, with nearly all infrastructure still intact. A good deal of potential deposits remain unexplored, just beyond the current mineshafts' reach. All we need to do is bring in modern equipment, and by the next day, we'll be unearthing enough uranium to power every single one of our reactors."
ATM_industrial_plants_r1_desc: "The paradoxical history of our nation is such, that a full century ago we were closer to reaching the atomic age than we are today. It was baby steps, but even such development would have saved us from the pitiful state we find ourselves in. Under the Soviets' forced patronage, Red Poland established a series of uranium processing plants deep in the wild mountains of Sudety. All of the resources acquired through the hard labor of Polish miners found their way into the greedy paws of our eastern overlords, but they couldn't lay their hands on all of the range's riches. There is still plenty of uranium left among the tonnes of metamorphic rocks, waiting to be uncovered. We'll reuse this derelict remnant of Poland's exploitation to turn it into radioactive gold. For the first time in its history, the plants will provide for their countrymen."
ATM_holy_cross_deposits_desc: "The nuclear potential of the Holy Cross mountains has long been known, with multiple expeditions conducted during the mid-20th century, yet despite all the uranium discovered in the northern half of the region, nothing has come of it except a few blots of data in some official's notebook. While we aren't exactly talking about the largest deposits out there, the ability to sufficiently reach them via conventional digging methods makes starting mining operations in the area a worthwhile possibility. With the precise information regarding the location and size of the primary veins available at our disposal, all we have to do is give the crews the orders and watch as Poland's oldest mountain range splits open to reveal its greatest treasure."
ATM_uranium_from_phosphorites_desc: "The area around Annopol is notoriously rich in phosphorites, which, in turn, are known for their high content of... uranium. That's right, these unassuming little rocks have the highest percentage of the wondrous element from among all non-conventional sources, completely dwarfing the yield from other prospective sites. We could drill into every hill in the country, but only here will we receive so much for so little effort. While the rocks are relatively rare, and if relied upon too much, will quickly be depleted, they will serve as a significant boost to our reactor's supply nonetheless. The only thing left to do is expand our mining operations in the area and enjoy the quick trickle that should cover our immediate demand."
ATM_search_in_the_north_desc: "The deposits up north are the true motherlode of precious uranium, utterly dwarfing its southern counterparts in size and potential. There is a good reason why this avenue hasn't been pursued before, however. They are nearly inaccessible without the employment of modern technological solutions, and any excavation efforts are bound to be associated with heavy costs. Additionally, certain deposits are located on environmentally safeguarded territory, further risking the ire of climate protection organizations. Yet all these challenges pale in comparison to the potential benefits. If we can tame the wild northern syneclises and establish mining operations, we will be able to establish a reliable flow of resources capable of supplying not just all of our energy needs but also providing for multiple generations that shall follow. Let's get digging!"
ATM_peribaltic_syneclise_desc: "Besides its primary effect of limiting our reliance on Russian-controlled waterways, the construction of the Vistula Spit Canal has had a secondary, albeit far more important consequence. Though the discovery was overlooked at first, the digging revealed large uranium deposits hidden within the sandstone rocks strewn around the territory. If initial data is to be believed, these pockets contain more of the resource than all other sites combined - over half of Poland's entire supply condensed into a single neat package. The main problem is, as always, accessibility, or lack thereof. The greatest prizes always come at the highest price, and the case is no different here. It will take a hefty investment to get the excavation efforts going, but the expected returns will more than make up for any sunk costs."
ATM_drilling_into_vistula_spit_desc: "The equipment is ready, and we can finally start drilling into the Vistula Spit. The terrain is unwelcoming, the area unsafe, and the public outcry severe but we stand on the precipice of abating our uranium supply issues, making the extraction not just a beneficial investment but a crucial matter for our national and energetic safety. The mining process isn't bound to progress without issue, however. Though we could somewhat guarantee the protection of forward crews from bandits and warlord armies, the necessity to disturb the fragile ecosystem of the local Landscape Park has ignited the anger of many activist groups who seem dedicated to indefinitely halt all of our machinery. They're not going to particularly like it, but we'll just have to... carefully push past them and continue digging. The matter is too crucial to give in to their demands."
ATM_podlasie_syneclise_desc: "The deep-lying shales of the Podlasie Syneclise are far from our first choice when it comes to uranium sources. Neither the largest nor the most accessible, the reliance on this deposit showcases our desperate need to acquire as much fuel for our nuclear power plant as possible within the short span remaining before it goes live. As we can't afford even the slightest risk of a shortage, this stream must also be promptly unlocked to subsidize our primary excavation operations. The cost is estimated to be quite heavy, potentially placing a significant burden on our checkbooks, but future generations will thank us for this selfless sacrifice. The uranium-rich rocks of Podlasie will be the final shining jewel in our atomic crown."
ATM_rajsk_uranium_mines_desc: "To expedite our northern mining ambitions, we can reliably draw upon old plans to serve as a guide in our excavation efforts. The village of Rajsk has previously been pinpointed as a suitable location to host a uranium mine thanks to the highly potent shale rocks deep in the soil beneath it. Back then, the idea fell through. This time, we'll finally bring it to fruition. In accordance with the long-dusted schemes and concept drawings, we'll construct an excavation site right in the center of the peaceful hamlet and grow it outward from there as operations inevitably expand. All we'd have to do is slightly relocate the population of the village... or perhaps the whole gmina if the situation deems it necessary."

ATM_heart_of_baluty_desc: "Swapping one set of problems for another doesn’t mean things get any easier. The immediate threats may be gone, but our prospects still remain rather bleak. The respite provided by the serenity of our bunker headquarters takes away from the cruel reality at hand - we’ve got a mountain to climb. Our projects are progressing far too slowly, the people and our former allies resent us, while our nosy Western neighbor, the wannabe European hegemon keeps prodding ever further into our business. As much as we’d like to take our foot off the gas for just a little while, we’re stuck in an endless spiral that keeps forcing us to constantly make our next move. Dark clouds are gathering over Poland, just as we were finally getting back on our feet, but we’ve weathered many storms, and this will be no different. Let’s get to work."
ATM_green_fury_desc: "Oh, what irony for a nation such as ours to suffer the ecologists' wrath. We've done everything right thus far, and yet, their discontent only grows. You can dedicate yourself to the environment, cripple your economic growth to combat climate change, but in the eyes of some, you'll never shake off the mantle of 'atomic terrorists.'  It's funny, really, what damage a simple disagreement can do. Being labeled as villains ain't nothing new, though it does sting coming from our former allies. We can't afford to have the activists sabotaging all our nuclear investments. The matter is too crucial. Our hands are tied, so for now, we'll simply proceed without them. Maybe if we ignore their hostile rhetoric, they'll tire themselves out, and all will go back to normal. After all, there isn't much a bunch of disorganized environmentalists can do to threaten us."
ATM_monsters_we_create_desc: "Well, apparently there is quite a lot they can do. We've expected nasty slogans and picket fences, but the Greenpeace fanatics have really crossed the line this time. In a way, we're partly to blame for this tragedy. We never should have given them this much power and free rein. The culprits have since withdrawn into hiding, evading all justice. They've shown they have no qualms about committing wanton terror in defense of their precious little ideals. They have embarked upon a warpath, and they will strike again. But, unlike the way they paint us, we're no monsters. Our predecessors would have killed the activists in cold blood, smoking them out one by one until the final traces of resistance had been snuffed out. However, we will not sit still as they take out our people. Something must be done, and if Greenpeace refuses to yield, we'll have to take care of things the hard way."
ATM_appeal_to_the_un_desc: "The anti-nuclear activists will never listen to our voice of reason. Even though our broad goals align, they refuse to pay heed to a single word uttered by 'puppets of Big Atom.' Luckily, there is one greater authority, far larger and more influential than our state, that these rabble-rousers continue to uphold as a moral standard. The UN has never been particularly friendly to our cause, infiltrated by the same misguided breed that continues causing trouble within our borders, but it has thus far been somewhat reasonable in its critique. We have our differences, but if we could establish contact and urge them to recognize us as worthwhile allies, it might be enough to cool down the tempers at home. Surely they'll see the benefits of working together over wasting precious time and resources squabbling with one another."
ATM_fruitless_effort_desc: "The United Nations has rebuffed us! How ironic that they claim the mantle of 'defenders of peace' yet the one time they can actually make an impact, they choose to back the insurgents actively devastating our territory. Over what? The petulant refusal to admit atomic energy's necessity in the climate struggle? Greta has to be out of her damn mind to think she's doing the right thing here. In her refusal to condemn them, she just passively legitimized the rebels' cause. This will only embolden them to conduct further acts of terror against our innocent supporters. Has there not been enough suffering and death already? Fine, if the UN is not on board, we'll handle the matter ourselves. They can lodge all the diplomatic protests they want. If they wanted a say in the matter, they should have taken our side."
ATM_strike_for_climate_desc: "As if a handful of dissidents wasn't enough, it appears the Greenpeace fanatics managed to turn a large portion of the population against us. Stoking fears of a potential nuclear catastrophe, they riled up our citizens enough for them to launch a large-scale campaign of civil disobedience. Within hours, nearly all production has ground to a halt, and even basic services have ceased to function. Our industrial system, so carefully built up over the past years, crumbled like an unsteady house of cards from a single gust of wind. Without crucial goods, the situation could soon turn critical once our emergency stockpiles run dry and the shortages fuel the flames of dissent. One way or another, we need to get the people back to their job sites. Even if it requires heavy concessions, we can't afford even a moment of delay, lest all our past efforts burn before our very eyes."
ATM_meeting_with_strikers_desc: "Even though they're actively paralyzing our nation, the majority of the strikers are not villains. They have been deceived, lied to by hostile influences, but they can be persuaded to return to the right path, and we'll forgive them and welcome them back into the fold as our prodigal sons. For that to take place, however, we first need to convince them to drop this charade so that life can return to normal. We've managed to secure a direct line of communication with the strike leaders. If we can get them to sit down with us and find a working compromise, the whole situation could be over in no time. Their fears are overblown, and if only they listen to reason and our copious amounts of prepared data, they will see the foolishness of their action. By the time we're done, they'll turn into our staunchest allies."
ATM_oh_the_irony_desc: "Well, they're even more pissed now, how lovely. Apparently, they didn't appreciate being bashed over the head with our pro-nuclear lectures. While they were willing to negotiate before, they now claim they'll never acquiesce to the demands of 'atomic terrorists,' outright demanding our deposition. The situation is worsening by the minute, and the threat of shortages looms large. Each day, new souls join the protests, which quickly spiral beyond any control. We need to act fast if we're to contain them. Our options are limited and we've already tried handling things the peaceful way. We don't want to set the precedent that dissent will be dismantled through the use of force, but we've been left with no other choice. We need to think this over. Maybe another solution will present itself, but the prospect seems increasingly less likely. There might only be one way forward. One we always wished to avoid."
ATM_at_least_fair_trial_desc: "So, it's come to this then. If we can't get the dissenters to cooperate, we'll have to forcefully break their resolve. We've tried everything, but it seems history has condemned us to be no better than the brutal regimes that came before us. As much as it pains us to have to carry out this sentence, our vision far outweighs the demands of the rebellious masses. We can't let them destroy all our hard work in pursuit of their foolish vision. The usage of nuclear energy is non-negotiable, and a handful of misguided activists won't change that. Through its destructive actions, the loudest contingent of rebels has sealed its fate. Without them, the rest should promptly disperse. There's no honor in convicting someone who fights for a noble cause, no matter how misled they may be. If we can't be lenient, let us at least be fair. This madness has to end."
ATM_suffocating_smoke_desc: "The dark clouds of smog prove time and time again to be more resilient than we could've possibly imagined. No matter what policies we set to combat the leftover airborne pollution, they grip desperately onto the skies, hide behind dark corners, and loom ominously over the same factories that once gave them birth. Like a wounded animal desperately scrambling for survival, the grey fog seems to retaliate against us in anger, descending onto urban areas and enclosing them in a suffocating capsule that continues to claim numerous lives of our citizens. And yet, with each passing month, the clouds' edges shrivel, and a trace of blue breaks through the vast gloomy seas of smoke. The great reduction plan is bearing fruit, and eventually, we'll eradicate the smog's final remnants, but if we are to live to see that day, we need to greatly accelerate its progress."
ATM_water_desc: "Our polluted rivers aren't so useless after all. Even when contaminated with tonnes of trash from every factory on their paths, their current still carries something invaluable - energy. So far, we've been rather slow and inefficient when it comes to harvesting this nearly infinite stream of free power. After all, constructing appropriate infrastructure is quite a heavy financial burden. Yet, as we inch ever closer to complete reliance on renewable energy, we can no longer neglect one of its primary sources. Poland is a land of rivers, perfectly capable of providing for us all. We must recognize these gifts of nature and build hydroelectric plants wherever the terrain allows it. It will be costly at first, but with proper planning and maintenance, we might finally be able to do away with the harmful coal-based systems left over from the previous governments."
ATM_air_desc: "While our lands aren't particularly blessed with strong winds, we are still far from utilizing the full potential of Zephyr's gifts. Even before the Fall, we were barely keeping pace with the global production leaders. In the many chaotic years since, nobody had either the resources or the will to develop even a single turbine while embroiled in near-constant warfare, but our increasingly stable and dominant position has allowed us to finally start drafting plans for the mass construction of wind power generators. Starting with the breezy coast, we'll create a network spanning as far as the eye can see - a field of giants, spinning graciously for the benefit of us all, towering over the landscape in an unceasing dance - proud symbols of our technological expertise and commitment to renewable energy production."
ATM_sun_desc: "Poland has always been a late adopter of the solar trend. When other nations were perfecting the technology's practical application, the use of panels was still in its infancy within our borders. Still, despite our slow start and harsh climate, we were on the right track to catch up, but our progress was interrupted by the Fall. After over a decade of turmoil, little remains of the vast seas of solar power collectors, most of which were destroyed in the fighting. Though the production and installation of countless panels are expected to put a noticeable dent in our yearly budget, we cannot rest until we complete the trifecta of renewable energy sources. We're on the cusp of achieving complete pollution-free energy independence, something thought to be a distant dream even during our country's better days. Let's prove the doubters wrong and make it a reality."
ATM_hydrogen_application_desc: "The wasteful times of relying on fossil fuels as our primary energy source are a thing of the past. We could drastically cut our emissions and combat plentiful health risks by turning to a new type of combustion - hydrogen power. While not nearly as effective as traditional fuel methods, utilizing the technology could greatly offset our carbon footprint and dispel any risks of a potential shortage. After all, it's quite hard to run out of the most abundant element in the entire universe. Though traditionally limited only to small engines in motor vehicles, with enough testing, we could expand its usage into nearly all industrial sectors, completely negating our previous dependence on coal. It would be a considerable, although negligible, sacrifice in productivity, but we can ensure smooth sailing and sustainability for years to come. In our situation, it's far better to have something reliable than risk a blackout like the one experienced by the Brotherhood."
ATM_co2_filters_desc: "Despite our progress, we still haven't been able to fully get rid of carbon, and likely won't be for a considerable amount of time. Certain industries simply don't have any applicable, environmentally-friendly alternatives to use as power sources, and completely shutting down crucial branches of our production is an untenable prospect. However, we don't have to sit idly as we are forced to emit harmful pollutants. Recent advances in technology have allowed the application of carbon dioxide filters, where ambient air is passed through an absorbent material that gathers CO2, which is then promptly condensed and turned into carbonate minerals. If sufficient efficiency of the process can be reached, we could reach net-zero emissions even in plants utilizing fossil fuels. Though it's only a temporary solution, it should be enough to serve us for many years to come."
ATM_achievements_of_reduction_plan_desc: "The reduction plan has been nothing short of controversial. Willingly slashing our production in such a trying time for a goal as abstract as combatting climate change surely didn't bring us any new allies. But even if it were to cause most of our former sympathizers to desert us, the success of the campaign can only be judged through one metric - whether it actually managed to lower our emissions. And to this end, we can, without any embellishment, refer to it as a success, albeit not a resounding one. We're on the correct path, and if we stick to it with as much dedication as thus far, we might actually have a shot at achieving environmental sustainability in the coming years. Thanks to our efforts, Poland is being reborn, and nature returns to reclaim its rightful lands, so violently stolen by our predecessors. We're doing the right thing. We just need to keep at it."
ATM_captain_planet_desc: "At the start of our atomic crusade, we inherited an environmental disaster unlike any seen before in the developed world. After over a decade of efforts to salvage what little remained of our fragile ecosystem and transition to renewable energy sources at breakneck speeds, we have managed to undo a century’s worth of damage and position ourselves as the leaders of a new, healthier age. Mother Nature is healing, and it’s all thanks to one man. Jakub Wiech has achieved the impossible, turning the tide in the global fight against climate change, and for the first time, instead of murmurs of doubt, the crowds cheer with enthusiasm at the sight of the visionary carrying them into the future. No longer the perpetual underdog, he has since come to be regarded for who he truly is - a hero; the planet’s greatest protector. As long as he stands, humanity’s destructive forces of greed shall never triumph."
ATM_black_eagle_desc: "Our western border is far from safe. One day, we could be celebrating our victories on the home front, the next we could lose it all in a renewed invasion. The Germans have already shown their willingness to interfere in our affairs, and their current rhetoric isn't any more friendly than it was all those years ago. Back then, they had their Union partners to stop them before they managed to fully subjugate us. This time, we won't be so lucky. The long-term goals of Energiewende are clear - the eradication of nuclear power worldwide. If they have the gall to bark at superpowers on the other side of the world, they aren't just gonna tolerate their eastern neighbor undergoing an atomic resurgence. Eventually, they're gonna strike. When they do, we'll teach them to stay on their own side of the Oder and never mess with Poland again."
ATM_fortify_border_desc: "Though natural obstacles give us some much-needed protection, the bridges on the Oder provide any would-be invader with a perfect opportunity to cross the mighty river. Once the Germans break into the vast open plains on its eastern side with their tank columns, there is little we can do to stop them from reaching our heartlands. Within minutes, we could find ourselves overrun and lose control of our best defense line. At that point, we might as well surrender. Once war breaks out, we can't expect to be given any time to prepare. We'll most likely face an immediate full-on assault. We must be ready so that at the first sight of enemy formations, we can blow up all the crossings, position our troops in their newly built fortifications along the river line, and shoot the Bundeswehr like sitting ducks as they try in vain to force their way through."
ATM_formation_of_minutemen_desc: "When our lines are inevitably breached, how much time will we have to plug the rapidly widening gap? An hour? A day? Definitely not long enough for our General Staff to gather and think of some miraculous plan to salvage the situation. Back in the day, we used to rely on our Territorial Defense Forces, however, their idea proved largely ineffective when faced with an actual threat. Under enemy fire, they crumbled, always late to the action, never enough to alter the battle's outcome. What we need is a unit that will be able to respond immediately, nullifying any danger at a moment's notice - requiring no longer than the proverbial minute to join the front lines. With the ability to reinforce seemingly at will, our lines will become unbreakable, and any hostile assault will grind itself down without achieving even a modicum of progress."
ATM_mine_the_coastline_desc: "We'd be foolish to think that in the increasingly likely event of war, we'd only face attacks across the length of the border. The way of conducting offensive operations is radically different than it was in the days of our forefathers, and we can expect nearly every avenue of breaking past our defenses to be exploited by our enemies. Amphibious assaults are always a lucrative prospect for securing coastal areas, and our shore is long and scarcely defended. We can't hope to match the German fleet in the Baltic Sea's frigid waters. In a pitched battle, we'd be repulsed with ease. Though securing naval supremacy is an impossible task, we can at least deny our opponents the ability to operate in the vicinity of our coast at will. To prevent the threat of possible landings, we'll cover the sea with a blanket of mines so thick, that not a single vessel will be able to swim through unscathed. If they want to invade us from the north, they'll pay a heavy price for their hubris."
ATM_lessons_from_fall_desc: "In terms of warding off against a German invasion, we already have a painful example of what not to do. The incompetence of Morawiecki's government turned what was supposed to be a grueling slog of a campaign into a cakewalk, stopped only by the increasing fears of Berlin's supremacy among its allies. If we are to face the full might of the Bundeswehr, we can't afford to let divisions and uncertain sympathies be our downfall. We need to make the message clear - we'd be defending against a hostile force, hellbent on subjugating every Pole under a system of foreign oppression. Additionally, as much as the military's politicization has helped us retain the average soldier's devotion to our cause, we have to transition to a more professional force - built not on the fickle personal loyalty to a political idea, but on the undying devotion to the Fatherland. In the face of German aggression, we will be united in our fight for the nation's survival."
ATM_approach_the_french_desc: "Even if we manage to hold off the initial push, we can seldom expect to keep the Germans at bay forever. Eventually, their industrial might will overwhelm us. For each bullet we lose, they can afford to fire ten, not to mention all the specialized equipment at their disposal. If we're to survive, we're gonna need allies. The French don't regard us with much love, but they'll jump at the chance to weaken their nemesis in a heartbeat. If they could send us some much-needed supplies, we should be able to mount a capable defense long enough for them to exert diplomatic pressure to stop the conflict. If we establish contact and show them our best side, they should be tempted to see us as a worthy ally. Our nations have always been naturally friendly, it's about time to revive our partnership."
ATM_dust_off_old_machines_desc: "In a time of war, we can hardly afford to be picky, especially when dealing with an enemy with more than double our production capability. Once it comes to blows, we're going to need every advantage we can get, and thus, even relying on the Brotherhood's old, questionable equipment models isn't out of the question. Luckily, our former opponents were gracious enough to leave us a hefty stockpile of unused test models which now slowly rust in warehouses scattered around the voivodeship, abandoned. Sometimes the difference between victory and defeat can be a single rudimentary machine that plugs a crucial gap. To maximize our chances, we'll carefully examine the state of all such pieces, establishing an inventory detailing what could potentially be given to our soldiers, and what is nothing more than a pile of useless junk. At least a good portion should still be serviceable, right?"
ATM_rad_eaters_desc: "Prior to the Fall, Polish special forces maintained a fearsome reputation, with groups such as GROM, Agat, and JWK regularly being regarded as some of the most effective combat teams across the entire continent, capable of competing with even the cream of the global crop. Regrettably, none of the organizations managed to survive the multiple trials and tribulations of the country's most turbulent period, but their legacy still remains, as do many of their former cadres. If we're to square up against the Germans in an open conflict, we'll likely need to heavily utilize elite formations to create advantages in the front's key locations. With the training infrastructure largely intact and a good portion of former commandos willing to serve as instructors, we are in a position to build up our own special forces unit, held to the same, if not even higher standard than before. Wherever the Rad-Eaters appear, they'll tip the scales of battle in our favor, no matter how difficult their task has to be."
ATM_hearts_and_minds_desc: "Fear. Despite our continued achievements, it cripples all further efforts to integrate nuclear energy into the public sphere. The uninformed masses tremble nervously at the mere mention of the expansion of our programs, quietly praying for our downfall in vain hopes of self-preservation. Poland, like no other nation, has been harmed by the Atom's destructive potential. Now even peaceful initiatives have come to be associated with the disasters in Bałuty and Chernobyl. We're at an impasse, forced to tone down our policies to avoid the people's ire. To break the stalemate, we have to soothe their fears, showing them what nuclear technology really is - a modern, safe solution to our nation's energetic woes. Dispelling decades of anti-atomic propaganda will be an enormous task, but if we can at least convince a sizeable portion of our population, we can expect things to be way easier going forward."
ATM_lead_by_example_desc: "We can't expect people to believe our claims of nuclear safety if we don't at least show our own trust in them. It's merely a formality, but we're long overdue for a little comeback tour of Bałuty. Even now, only the bravest of souls dare tread on this desolate land, adding to the mythos about the risk a single atomic discharge, whether accidental or not, can pose. Of course, we're fully aware the area is safe. We literally spent months hiding in the blast zone's immediate vicinity. Still, it won't hurt to revisit the territory, turning the trip into a full-on PR stunt. Televise our appearance, take a few soil samples, and run a bunch of tests to show there's no lasting radiation. If we ensure everyone's watching, we might be able to once and for all prove that even the worst nuclear tragedy we've witnessed pails in comparison with the everyday destruction of coal."
ATM_affirmation_campaign_desc: "We’ve always made efforts to soften the Atom’s tarnished image in the minds of our people but without a fully-fledged campaign, there isn’t much we can hope to establish, especially with the Bałuty tragedy still so freshly etched into the collective memory. Many fail to see the difference between harmless nuclear power and the destructive potential of atomic weaponry. If we are to calm down their fears, we need to make it known that the 'terrifying megastructure ominously looming over their homes' belongs firmly in the first category, and won’t, in fact, blow up, devastating half the country. To make the distinction painfully clear, we’ll distribute flyers, plaster cities with billboards, and arrange open meetings with experts in nuclear technology for anyone having doubts about the project’s safety. By the time we’re done, every citizen will know there is nothing to fear."
ATM_we_could_use_media_desc: "Having a friendly media apparatus diligently working to spread your ideals to the masses isn't necessarily a bad thing, even if the truth has to sometimes be bent to keep you in the positive light. In controlling the press, the Brotherhood had the right idea but ruined it through terrible execution. We don't need to make up outright lies and censor all other viewpoints to appear like the good guys. We know we're right; we just have to ensure everyone gets the message. If we employ sufficient favoritism so that friendly publications can always maintain an edge over their competitors, soon every citizen will be seeing our narrative, complete with all the knowledge necessary to wholeheartedly stand by it, before coming across a single word thrown by our detractors to debunk it. Afterward, nobody in their right mind would even consider doubting us."
ATM_rewrite_education_system_desc: "The effects of decades of politicized education and blatant misinformation by those entrusted to shape the minds of our youngest citizens are plain to see. We have raised a generation of arrogant halfwits, unable to hold a single independent thought, perfectly poised to resonate the lies they've been repeatedly bashed with. The alumni of the Brotherhood Education System are largely a lost cause, but we can prevent such a situation from happening in the future. School isn't meant to drill its students into one correct way of thinking, even if it's our teachings it could be spreading. We need a true platform for critical thought that encourages discussion, diligent fact-checking, and methodical research. Unlike our opponents, we don't need to tell our kids what to believe. As long as we give them the appropriate tools to seek out the truth, they'll realize it lies with us anyway."
ATM_reintroduction_of_studies_desc: "To manage our multiple specialized and cutting-edge projects we require a large quantity of highly trained personnel. Regrettably, to say we lack sufficient cadres would be a vast understatement, as the suspension of nearly all higher education and persecution of anyone whose knowledge could be deemed dangerous have led to Europe’s largest case of brain drain, with the majority of experts having left for greener pastures. Even if some could be enticed to return, we're left with a generational gap of unskilled labor. If we resume the operation of the various technical colleges within our territory, placing a heavy emphasis on nuclear research and engineering within their curriculums, we might eventually be able to fill up the majority of crucial posts with a new breed of promising, ambitious professionals, though it will likely take multiple years before we see a full return on our investment into their futures."
ATM_children_of_atom_desc: "Poland's youngest generation, born and raised under our protective custody, is a source of near-limitless potential, uncorrupted by the evil lies of past regimes and traumatic events that shaped our nation's present consciousness. If properly nurtured, they could be the key to a brighter future for us all, but in order to set them on the right path, we must utilize their formative years by instilling the proper values into their vulnerable minds. Starting with primary schools and kindergartens, teachers will extol the virtues of the Atom in a simple, comprehensible form that makes the use of nuclear energy for the country's betterment sound as natural and fundamental as basic addition. For those willing to go the extra mile, we'll prepare a range of extracurricular activities, clubs, and groups to join to further spread the cause. It's a far cry from the devotion demanded by the youth organizations once operated by our despised predecessors, but it's still an effective way to ensure the kids' undying loyalty under the guise of carefree fun."
ATM_knowledge_is_death_of_fear_desc: "We've done all we could, repeatedly showing our citizens the safety of nuclear energy. Many of them listened. Some of our fiercest enemies have since joined our ranks as ardent supporters of the atomic cause. But not everyone has been so receptive. Many within the older generations continue their staunch opposition to anything nuclear, still babbling about disasters they barely remember. It will take a while before the stories that now circle Poland as legends, told by elders as a cautionary tale against placing too much trust in the Atom's reliability, finally die out. The youths have learned to tout the glory of nuclear power, displaying devotion we haven't witnessed since our initial battle against Ziemkiewicz's forces. Soon, they will form the backbone of Polish society, and our cause will be entrenched in the hearts and minds of our population."
ATM_utilize_radiation_desc: "Our recent excavation efforts have given us access to the holy grail of all energy sources - uranium. All of the conventional methods we've worked with thus far pale in comparison with the potency of even a single chunk of this wondrous ore. It's no exaggeration to say we've unlocked the true potential we've always strived for. Of course, regrettably, uranium does have its downsides, and as much as we'd like to expand its usage, the inherent radioactivity does, in fact, pose a serious risk. We know well enough not to sacrifice our people at the altar of progress, but the benefits are simply too high to pass up. We hold the key to our victory. Now, we have to decide what matters more - the individual or the greater good."
ATM_deadly_but_safe_desc: "We're not senseless monsters. If we're to utilize radioactive materials, it will all be done with one rule in mind - the safety of our citizens comes first. It's a real shame we won't ever be able to harness the full power of fission, but we've witnessed firsthand what destruction the mindless chase to completely exploit a resource's potential can bring. They say power corrupts, but we refuse to be tempted. Besides, we're not missing out on much. There are plenty of ways to safely make use of uranium, and our engineers are already hard at work to conceptualize our first projects. We can dream about what could've been, but we've made the right choice. We've kept our hearts in the right place, and our people will be grateful. We won't regret this. We can't."
ATM_uranium_armor_desc: "Depleted uranium, acquired as a by-product of the manufacturing of its enriched counterpart for use as fuel in our nuclear reactor has a few interesting properties of its own. Thanks to containing a lesser degree of the most fissile isotope, the metallic form is notable for its extremely high density, allowing it to serve as the perfect plating material for our armored vehicles. If fitted onto tanks between the sheets of steel, we could potentially greatly improve their resilience, rendering them nearly impenetrable to most conventional anti-armor weaponry. Of course, encasing our soldiers in what is essentially a radioactive capsule is a major health concern, but exposure should be limited enough not to pose significant risks during a standard battlefield shift. If circumstance forces them to operate for lengthier periods of time at once... well, that's what field hospitals are for."
ATM_uranium_bullets_desc: "Just as our capabilities rise, so do those of our enemies. Our recent wars have shown that we no longer have a monopoly on armor. Rather than blast hostile tanks with hundreds of useless pellets, we can use depleted uranium from our nuclear power plant to produce state-of-the-art piercing shells. With a sharper core that prevents fracturing on impact and subsequent easy flammability, these vessels of destruction will lay waste to even the toughest of platings with a single salvo. Through the mass application of this technology in specialized anti-tank battalions, we'll be able to completely nullify our foes' ability to conduct armored warfare. If they even so dare as to deploy their machinery anywhere near the frontline, we'll be sure to locate, target, and promptly annihilate it until they eventually retreat in shame, on foot."
ATM_nuclear_jets_desc: "The idea of equipping aircraft with nuclear propulsion is an old one, dating back to the early days of the Cold War, yet the concept never reached past the experimental stage. Even if enough energy could be generated to power the vehicles mid-flight, the problem of insufficient radiation shielding has long eluded scientists and engineers alike. But, where they faced difficulty, we see an opportunity. Thanks to the rapid pace of technological advancement, we might be able to find a suitable balance between efficiency and personnel safety. If we were to successfully produce a combat-ready model, we would have an advantage not just over the remaining warlords, but over the global hegemons as well. They still believe us to be fighting with makeshift guns and baseball bats. Imagine the surprise in their eyes when we show off a design they deemed impossible to pull off."
ATM_nuclear_engines_desc: "Ever since the power of the Atom was first harnessed, naval and nuclear developments have always been intertwined. The massive, slow-moving marine behemoths serve as perfect vessels for nuclear propulsion to be applied thanks to their rather uniform power usage across the majority of a typical cruise. The isolation provided by the vastness of the sea carries the additional benefit that if anything were to truly go wrong, any system failure would be a purely localized incident, without the risk of damage to the integrity of the remainder of the fleet. Though traditional applications are mostly contained to submarine models, the Polish Navy's near-complete destruction during the Invasion affords us the unique possibility to rebuild it from scratch, with the usage of atomic energy to power our ships as the standard set across the board. Starting with small cruisers and destroyers, we will build the world's largest nuclear fleet, perhaps one day fielding the first carrier to ever sail the Baltic Sea."
ATM_sacred_losses_desc: "Health concerns are an important factor, but in our current situation, we can't afford to prioritize the safety of a select few over the interests of everyone else. With dangers lurking around every corner, it would be insane to limit our potential over some humanitarian outcry. Of course, it's immoral to condemn a portion of our soldiers to a horrible, painful death as a result of radiation sickness. That's why they're heroes for so bravely volunteering to carry out such missions. If they hadn't, we'd all likely be dead, subjugated by a stronger force that does not hold back to ponder the righteousness of its actions. If we're to reach the lofty heights demanded by our ambitions, we'll need to harness the full power of the Atom, that is clear as day. We're making the mother of all omelettes. We can't fret over every egg."
ATM_precise_dispersion_desc: "Our critics love to claim we're oblivious to the dangers of radiation. Far from it. Yet unlike their limited, fearful minds, we see it as a potential waiting to be utilized, not avoided. If we were to strategically place radioactive materials near enemy formations, or perhaps within our own positions before conducting a tactical retreat, we could expect the particles fired off from the decaying nuclei to slowly cripple hostile armies without the need to fire a single bullet. As if struck by an unknown plague hanging over the battlefield, our rivals will drop like flies, leaving us to pick off all the remnants. Some more critical voices might label this plan as a supposed 'war crime,' but is it really any different than killing them the old-fashioned way? If anything, we're leaving those combatants with a unique chance to survive our assaults, if they manage to recover from the horrors of radiation sickness, of course."
ATM_attack_of_dead_men_desc: "Terraforming the battlefield into an irradiated, inhospitable wasteland that no human can survive in doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing. If we force the enemy to abandon, or at least weaken their positions to avoid the harmful effects of radiation that decimates their soldiers, we would find ourselves in the perfect position to conduct a devastating attack through the thinned-out lines, creating a powerful spearhead that could break any defense apart All we have to do is equip our soldiers with enough protective gear to survive the conditions long enough to complete their objectives. Their fate will likely be sealed, but it's better to condemn hundreds than to potentially lose tens of thousands in ineffective, conventional attacks. There is no greater honor than to die amongst the Atom's power, witnessing the force of radiation firsthand. If anything, the chosen should consider themselves lucky. They gave their lives for a good cause."
ATM_zeppelin_in_atomic_age_desc: "Ever since the Hindenburg tragedy over a hundred years ago, Zeppelins have been considered an unsafe, antiquated mode of travel. It's an incredibly close-minded way of thinking, especially since airships require far less power, both during takeoff, as well as on cruising altitude - making them the perfect vessel for nuclear compulsion to be applied. Another advantage is clear - the ability to spend multiple hours, potentially even days on continuous patrol, like an all-seeing watchman guarding us from the skies. And, if equipped with appropriate weaponry and somehow snuck into enemy territory, our Zeppelins could wreak havoc far behind their lines, striking at the industrial centers beyond the reach of conventional weaponry. By repurposing old Brotherhood projects and refitting them with the appropriate power source, we could immediately begin production, largely bypassing the planning stage. All the pieces are in place. We just need to set everything into motion."
ATM_modernization_of_mi14pl_desc: "During the Cold War, many of the foremost powers experimented with helicopters that could carry a nuclear payload. Able to operate with far greater flexibility than traditional aircraft, especially useful when battling against moving targets and conducting functions at lower altitudes. The Soviet sphere frequently utilized these machines, but the design has since become largely antiquated, relying on technologies patented over half a century ago. The core design is solid, potentially granting us the ability to enhance our air-to-ground nuclear capabilities, although it requires heavy improvements to bring it up to date with the requirements of modern warfare. If we could get our hands on the appropriate design specifications, we should be able to retrofit the models with our newest advancements. At that point, the helicopters should be able to stand up to even the most effective air defense systems."
ATM_threat_of_the_future_desc: "When we first started our struggle, our army consisted of nothing more than a bunch of glorified partisans. In the many years since, we've successfully transformed it into perhaps the most dedicated fighting force in all of Europe, armed to the teeth with a plethora of groundbreaking technologies. But, above all, we're no longer just chasing global trends. Our ubiquitous use of nuclear energy across all branches of our armed forces places us at the forefront of a coming revolution that will forever redefine the art of war, launching it squarely into the atomic age. Through our achievements, we have redefined the world's polarity, disturbing the hegemony of the current superpowers. They despise our drive, accusing us of playing with fire at everyone's expense, but mostly, they fear being left behind. We are the first to make this forward leap, but we won't be the only ones. Yet, as they attempt to catch up to us, we'll always be ten steps ahead, forever the pioneers of nuclear weaponry."
ATM_medical_usage_desc: "The lingering smog is a slow but methodical killer. Its continued presence has given rise to all kinds of illnesses, chief among them cancers. Given the current state of our overburdened healthcare system, such a diagnosis has thus far nearly always been a death sentence. No longer. Our society is ailing, and we have the cure. Radioisotope treatment has long been regarded as one of the greatest breakthroughs in the field of oncology, but the cost and difficulty of procuring suitable therapeutics have been deemed far too large for us to invest. Now that we have access to some... less-proven isotopes, we can finally bring the idea to life. While a number of doctors have raised concerns over the safety and potential side effects of using highly radioactive materials on patients without first conducting appropriate clinical trials, the benefits largely outweigh all potential risks. After all, it's all the same process anyway. What's the worst that can happen?"
ATM_agricultural_usage_desc: "Polish agriculture is yet to fully recover from the damage dealt by the Brotherhood during its short reign over Łódzkie. In our efforts to continue its revitalization, we have just acquired a powerful, albeit unexpected nuclear ally. The radiation emitted by the decay of unstable elements provides radiographic potential to determine the best placement and application of fertilizers, and, due to its harmful effects on animals, allows an unmatched degree of pest control that could replace the usage of pesticides. Besides, just as the nearly inhospitable conditions and earth pollution accelerated the natural selection of the most resilient plant strains, so too can radiation be used to induce mutations that might help us breed higher-yield variants. For once, the science here is foolproof, tested over multiple continents and soil types. The conclusion is clear - our agricultural woes are about to be overcome."
ATM_industrial_usage_desc: "Uranium's potential applications within various sectors of industry are largely marginal, and thus oft overlooked, but we always remain open to new solutions utilizing nuclear materials. Besides usage for R&D purposes,   we stand poised to develop the field of industrial radiography, allowing for the precise imaging of internal features of metals and welds used in our infrastructure, especially the frequently shoddy parts constructed by vanquished warlords, to check for any potential structural defects. Additionally, the unstable molecules can also be used for the sterilization of food and hospital supplies, as well as the function of gauging devices that precisely control the density and thickness of used materials. All of these uses are minor and mostly situational, but they quickly add up, allowing us to stand at the forefront of industrial innovation. No longer will Poland be the technological backwater of Europe. From now on, we set the global standards."
ATM_last_son_of_atom_desc: "We've achieved much for our nation, defying expectations at nearly every step to transform it from a war-torn wasteland into an up-and-coming superpower. The country has been reborn, placed under competent leadership for perhaps the first time in its long, storied history. The lush green fields of Western Poland, the scenic coastlines of Pomerania, the untamed mountains of the Tatra highlands - sights thought forever lost to time have been reclaimed, harmoniously blended with a sustainable nuclear industry that will serve as the nation's unshakeable backbone for centuries to come. We stand at the cusp of victory, yet one enemy remains in our path, increasingly envious of our rising strength and international standing. From their seat of power in Berlin, the Germans look upon us with flaming wrath as the antithesis of their anti-nuclear rhetoric, the exemplification of all their misguided shortcomings. Whether we like it or not, we'll have to curb their imperial dreams."
ATM_winter_is_coming_desc: "The German menace won't give in lightly. They keep testing us, methodically increasing the tensions on the border and prodding at our weaknesses to get us to break. They've made their position clear - conflict is unavoidable, and they are preparing for the final showdown to settle our grudges once and for all. There can be no negotiating with Berlin. They know that if they don't defeat us now, they'll likely never get another opportunity to prevent us from eclipsing their once-formidable might. Every day, more soldiers line up on the Oder's shores, awaiting the fateful command to strike. Soon, the waters will run red with the blood of the fallen, but we are not without a choice in the matter. We can either take a waiting stance, preserving our strength in preparation for the inevitable attack, or conduct a decisive strike that might render them helpless before they even manage to figure out a response. Our decision could alter the fate of our entire nation."
ATM_nuclear_winter_desc: "The last few decades have turned Germany into an unreconcilable climate terrorist, utterly convinced of the righteousness of their anti-atomic Energiewende policy. They wish to impose their will upon the world, starting with their rebellious neighbor - Poland. Those who try colonialism once, often develop a taste for it, and the bureaucrats in Berlin are quite the connoisseurs. Since they had us in their grasp once, it's much harder to let go now. We can keep groveling like their little puppets, or we can finally assert our independence. Waiting passively will do us no good. If we're to truly show our resolve, we'll need to be proactive. The Germans will never learn not to tread on us unless we give them a taste of their own medicine. Luckily, we have the perfect surprise just for this occasion."
ATM_western_crusade_desc: "The Germans listen only to arguments of strength. They think they can bully us, but this time, we'll fight back. To once and for all crush the Black Eagle's imperialistic ambitions, we'll have to clip its wings so that it may never fly again. Together with our French allies, we have no choice but to conduct a two-pronged offensive, striking Germania from both the East and West. We will attack first, pushing past the Oder all the way to the Elbe, while French columns advance to reach the Rhine. Coupled with our little 'gift,' that should be more than enough to completely collapse the hostile government, forever freeing us, and Europe, from Berlin's tyranny. On the ashes, we'll rebuild the continent anew, stronger than ever, placed firmly under our rightful leadership. The end of an era approaches."
ATM_what_berlin_desc: "The day of reckoning has come. We can no longer tolerate Germany's impunity. Even when faced with the inevitability of our triumph, they refuse to yield by a single inch. They resent us. They think we don’t have the guts. They'd rather let their whole country burn just so they don't have to live to see themselves overshadowed by a strong, united Poland. If that is what they want, so be it. We'll cut the snake's head off before the Germans even realize what happened. In the dark of night, we'll sneak a team of our most loyal soldiers deep into enemy territory. Their mission will be simple. Reach Berlin with their payload, and once in the vicinity of a convened Bundestag, detonate the warhead and promptly end all German leadership. We wanted peace, but for it to be achieved, Berlin must be cleansed with nuclear fire."
ATM_and_we_are_ready_desc: "The line between righteous self-defense and condemnable offensive actions is thin, but even when repeatedly provoked, we refuse to cross it. The Germans are testing us. They want us to attack and confirm the international community's unwarranted fears about our movement. By no means will we ever willingly fall into their trap. They know they're losing. They're acting out of desperation. With each passing day, we're only getting stronger while Enegiewende wriggles in its dying throes. Soon, they'll be in no position to challenge us, reduced to a sad little rump state, for which their former hegemonic ambitions will be nothing more than nostalgia. The polarity of the world is changing, and we're emerging as the planet's primary environmental guardians, the heralds of a new, sustainable era. All we have to do is weather this final storm."
ATM_watchers_on_the_oder_desc: "Confrontation is unavoidable, but we'll make sure it happens on our terms only. Our western neighbors are itching for a fight, but we'll force them into submission without even firing a single bullet. Since they can't behave, together with our allies in the European Community, we'll enforce a complete embargo on all German products, essentially cutting them off from the world at large. Nevertheless, we must be ready for war. Our eternal enemy won't let itself be starved out without a fight, and so we need to mobilize the whole nation and increase combat readiness along our western flank in preparation for the onslaught to come. We'll protect the Oder with all our might so that no German may slip through to our lands. Berlin shall learn the meaning of hunger until they finally come crawling to the negotiating table, begging for us to relieve them."
ATM_call_berlin_desc: "We've softened them up enough, now is the time to make the Germans pay. Our list of demands is long, a reflection of the plentiful grudges we hold for the decades of meddling in our sovereignty. One could say it's almost impossible to meet our ultimatum without permanently compromising Berlin's international standing and economy. That is precisely the goal - cripple them thoroughly enough so that they may never threaten us again. The Chancellor can kick and scream about the harshness of our requests, but if he has any sense of self-preservation left, he'll accept them anyway. His nation is alone, suffering in its isolation, crying out for relief at all costs. Of course, once his countrymen learn of the burden about to befall them for their government's actions, chaos will ensue on the streets of Germania. That, however, is not our problem. For us, that is merely the sight of triumph."

atom_cw.1.desc: "- Halina, c'mere! The boss's almost started 'is speech.\n - As if his speeches were that interesting...\n- As if there was somethin' else to watch... - Robert bit back - Now, quit complaining!\n - Dear miners and all those who support the carbon cause - Ziemkiewicz started, not caring about the couple's quarrel in the slightest - The last few years were tough for all of us. But a bright, coal-fueled future is upon us. Especially once we've eliminated all foreign agents, such as those atomic terrorists led by *zzz*.\nZiemkiewicz's exposé - as well as Robert's and Halina's quarrel - was interrupted by static.\n- The hell? - Halina's husband was sure the Brotherhood always ensured top-quality signal during the Elder's speeches.\nRobert's surprise was even greater after three mysterious silhouettes appeared on the TV screen.

Two crude, homemade machine guns that looked like something straight out of the Warsaw Uprising, along with a box of bullets that would last them for maybe 3 magazines each. Kazik picked one up and started looking it over.\n\n- Nice. This should pack a pretty good punch. The bolt could be more sturdy though.\n\n-Shouldn’t these be better hidden? Seems like a pretty obvious spot if you ask me.\n\n- Yeah, they’re easy to find if you know about them. Most Paladins are only good at burning books anyway.

Nearly every tree was burned here, as it was in a considerable part of other forests in the Łódź Voivodeship. It's beyond my comprehension what the Brotherhood of Coal was up to in their despotic, anti-human rule, or what they still planned to do if it weren’t for us.\n\nWe had seen much already - cities, clearings, forests, waterside areas—all destroyed by the actions of people who spoke so much about progress. However, one might rather call it regression. Around 1 p.m., after a long journey through these devastated areas, we arrived at the Bełchatów power plant, recently taken over by our people. From a distance of several kilometers, our large banners hanging down from the highest points of the power plant's structures were visible.\n\nThe tour covered all the key facilities of the power plant, all secured by our soldiers. We checked whether the Brotherhood soldiers hadn't hidden any unpleasant traps that could harm us. After the inspection, we went to the power plant's parking lot. Besides the soldiers, our local officials were waiting, as well as residents from nearby villages and distant cities like Łódź, Bełchatów, Piotrków Trybunalski, or Skierniewice. Everyone who came had enough of the terrifying rule of the Brotherhood of Coal and welcomed their liberation by the soldiers of the Crusade with relief.\n\nOn the way here, as the adjutant to our leader, I had the opportunity to talk with him. He was aware of the journey he had undertaken so far, but also of what he still had to achieve. Despite defeating the tyrants of the Brotherhood, our homeland was still not unified. It was still divided, and in this anarchy, there could be even worse warlords than Rafał Ziemkiewicz. He was visibly stressed, but I see tremendous determination in him. None of us expected to be in this situation now. At the end of the inspection, Wiech delivered a speech. He spoke about defeating the Brotherhood of Coal and stopping their dreadful plans, which led to the destruction of the ecosystem and, consequently, Poland.

However, the biggest pest was still at large, and if you don’t remove cancerous cells, they may cause metastasis.\n\nOnce it was obvious that the fall of Bełchatów was imminent, Łukasz Warzecha saw the writing on the wall and decided to do what was best for him. As the Crusade was approaching, he quickly left Bełchatów, and with only a few vital items by his side, he hid in the nearby village of Huta. Many days have since passed, and the fighting has long gone silent. "Ziemkiewicz surrendered," he thought, although he still saw flags he pledged loyalty to waving at the local fire station. “Has Ziemkiewicz done the impossible?”, “But defeat seemed so imminent.” He knew one thing - if Ziemkiewicz survived, the Paladin would have to redeem himself for betraying his leader so quickly.\n\nIn order to do that, he traveled to the broadcasting station in Piotrków, capturing some lost environmentalist on the way. The building was empty, but the power remained on, presenting Warzecha with a great opportunity. He quickly placed the hostage on the stage. Lights, cameras, action. He could seldom utter a single word before the rusted doors sprung open, and Warzecha found himself surrounded by a unit of Crusaders. Unbeknownst to him, Łukasz Warzecha has just willingly entered the lion’s lair.\n\nHe was taken to the closest court, with a cameraman in front of him during the whole journey, where Jakub Wiech, the Atomic Crusader himself, was waiting for the Paladin’s trial.

Forming many organizations on the verge of legality and organizing cells all around the former Łódź Voivodeship, they did whatever they could to turn the populace against atom.\n\nAt the same time, Jakub Wiech tried to organize actions to promote his agenda, which mostly entailed the liberalization of many leftover, nonsensical policies. One such policy was about “green cuisine”, which tried to encourage people to eat more healthily. It's no surprise the remnants of the Brotherhood went on a campaign against eating any greens, trying to portray vegetables as weak and leftist. But the most important program was Wiech’s campaign on coal - that which the Brotherhood regarded as a sacred treasure. Obviously, any slander against it was out of the question in the deeply brainwashed society. One wrong word and the people would voice their discontent on the streets. \n\nFor now, the opposition decided to settle for an occasional feisty exchange of words in the press or flyers and rational (in their outlook) argumentation - reduction of coal usage may mean reduction of production, especially when it’s too hastily done."

Despite this, the pay allowed for a very comfortable life, considering the standards of the fallen state. The Brotherhood itself supported employees of military facilities and their families, providing the best available housing, education, access to healthcare, and the possibility of very long vacations funded by the state.\n\nThere were concerns that when the Atomic Crusade ultimately wins, its destructive policies would undermine what the Brotherhood had built. Those concerns were justified. About a week after the final victory of the Crusade and the establishment of local administration, layoffs began. Szymański's facility was also affected. Many of his colleagues lost their jobs. He feared the same fate, especially since the government planned to revoke the privileges of employees of military facilities and their families. Once again, it was impossible to deny him reason.\n\nAnd then, one time, on a sunny Sunday morning, a letter came to Szymański from his employer with some important and very bad news. It turned out that Szymański also fell victim to mass layoffs in the arms factories, which in a state less militaristic than Brotherhood, did not need as many workers. Not all seemed lost because, as compensation, the state offered assistance in finding new employment and temporary financial support to anyone who applied locally. \n\nThe next day, he went to the city office, where it was not difficult to find what he was looking for, as the queues stretched infinitely. After a long wait, when his turn finally came, it turned out that the only job offer he could get was assisting in cow farming somewhere near Ozorków. It was better paid than assembling rifles, but he had no idea about farm work.

All the years of planning and careful scheming only to be judged by some half-wits. Of course, he wasn't going to say those things out loud. His situation was grim as it was. He'll stay silent. That has always been his reliable modus operandi. Insulting the judge in the style of Rzymkowski or trying to bargain as Gadomski would just anger everybody.\n\n - ...Your Honor - the prosecutor was finishing his final speech - we all know the reasons you have deemed Rafał Ziemkiewicz guilty. It is only fitting to punish the architect and an executioner of the very same political persecution that was associated with Ziemkiewicz. And we know some of his crimes will never see the daylight due to the destruction of numerous documents before the Crusaders' takeover. I petition for the death penalty. \n - Your Honor, lack of evidence cannot be used to condemn the accused. And the evidence we have suggests the life penalty would be more suitable.\n - Don't you dare defend this bastard! - an anonymous voice shouted starting chaos in the courtroom.\n - Order! Order! Order!\n\nAfter the deliberation Judge Wesołowska reaches a verdict in Spider's case."

Today he was carrying one of the most important documents in the Brootherhoods of Coal's history - the files with Janecki's hooks. The massive folder he was carrying was so crucial, the Great Ecologist himself wanted to study them first.\n - Those are those files you wanted - Byzdra handed the papers to his superior, skipping the formalities. After all, him and Wiech go way back.\n - Thank you, Karol - Wiech replied getting ready to open the files. Anxiety filling his mind.\n - I hope he's not angry at me he's not the first one to open them. It's a shame that I can't even trust my closest allies. - the Great Ecologist thought to himself when his minister of interior left. \nPersonal feelings aside, Janecki was the greatest example what happens when secret services run rampant and he wasn't going to let that happen.\n - Alright, enough pondering. Let's see what those files hide.\nIt turned out they hide a lot of things. All the indirect proof damning the Brotherhood members were confirmed by Janecki's documents. He even gathered evidence against himself, making the list of his crimes even longer than any of the Crusaders have thought.\n - It's a shame, we've already sentenced the bastard.\nThere were also details about the opposition members who went MIA. A lot of them were executed as expected, but some of them were imprisoned in secret underground jails. Jails the Crusaders knew nothing about.\n - We can still save those people.\nLastly, Wiech turned his eyes to the dreaded chapter containing the information about the hooks and spies in the Atomic Crusade.\nNeither Byzdra nor Czyżewski were mentioned there.\n - Thank God. - No catalogue of files, no matter how big, could describe the relief Wiech felt at that moment.\nTurns out the Crusade was keeping its secrets. Most of the spies were common grunts. Some were lower ranking officer. They were recruited just before the great uprising against the Brootherhood, so Janecki hadn't had enough time to harm them.\n - We have to act quickly. We must prevent the possible Brotherhood coup.\nthere were also files concerning the Great Ecologist as well.\n - If he had hooks against me, why didn't he use them to blackmail me and get a lower sentence.\n\nAnd then Wiech learned why.\n\n - Oh, it's definitely embarrassing, but nothing that would compromise his position on the long run.\n\nHe quickly burned the 'evidence' and started writing a letter to Byzdra concerning a new series of legal cases against the traitors mentioned by Janecki."

All we worked for faded and died, rotting in front of our eyes. And how do we breathe that life back into it, without energy?\n\nIrena lived ninety winters already, and contrary to everyone’s expectations, her health has never faded. As the world and the nation collapsed and joined the likes of the third world, as thousands died and many more fled, as her hometown, Łódź was lit up by the second sun, she was one of the few whose routine never changed. She used to get up in the morning and work as a childrens’ caretaker. Now that most children fled with parents, leaving the desperate and the lonely behind, she maintained their furniture. She knew life does not ever really change. That these decrepit flat stacks around here were more alive than they seemed. Poland lived. The only dead thing... were the promises people far away from her were making. Dead on arrival.\n\n- Atom was the promise of better life for all of us, free from the diktat of those we’d been forced to buy energy from. Atom was sovereignty in its purest form. Atom was being unburdened by energy bills. But fear not. The reason it was not meant for you, is because your rulers never understood nor trusted it. We do understand it. We do trust it. We know how to keep these tragedies from ever happening again. And by 2050, the promise of Atom will be yours again. By 2050, the nuclear option will free us again! Human ingenuity will break free of all its limits, again. And this time, we’ll take to the stars.\n\nThe voice must have belonged to yet another politician who wormed his way to leading what’s left of us. Or some other warlord. What’s the difference anyway? Between them both... Irena would keep getting up in the morning, pretending to gossip with her peers, work, read... The more things changed, the more they’d stay the same. Not even the meltdown of the Łódź power plant would prevent that. Not one silly promise of some Brother who may as well have been the alter ego of the last one, would change that.\n\nAnd yet, as the speech on the radio halted and applause gave way, she took a look at the direction of the Exclusion Zone.

The reason I joined the Atomic Crusade was hunger, after I ran afoul of the Brotherhood occupiers, I wasn't even trying to get to Berlin. But the camaraderie of the Crusade is what I stayed for. Mere weeks ago I was singing praises of our leaders and storming the Bełchatów Power Plant. After our victory, they told us rather unceremoniously that being a partisan was not the same as being a frontline soldier, and that our new training programme would include starting from point zero.\n\nThey say the frontline troop is meant to withstand the worst of the worst, and they were definitely preparing us for that. And that comes from me, someone already used to never getting enough sleep and nocturnal ops from partisan life. Other recruits were not as lucky.\n\nEven the food got worse. The partisan life meant you would end up eating anything you can get your hands on, which filled your heart with hope that you might find something decent for a change. Combat situations were swift, sudden, and we were always striking first so long as our operational security was going well. Here, you are forevermore stuck eating the same beet-potato slop that was probably genetically engineered to numb your higher cognition. I was broken, hazed like a cattle, demoralized into doing the hazing of new recruits, and still had camaraderie... in a half-dead, broken state of mind. My memory consisted of foggy memories on obstacle courses and live round battle exercises. And once in a while, I dream of still being in Poznań, my girlfriend lying on the sofa, smiling through her golden hair as I walked over to her and...\n\n- BULLSHIT PRIVATE, YOUR GIRL IS A FUCKING PENNER, BLOWING EVERY SINGLE POZNAŃ GANGSTER AS WE SPEAK! GET ON YOUR FACE AND GIMME 25!\n\nThis godforsaken voice now wormed its way into my head. I fought instinct to not get on my face and start doing the push-ups as I regained consciousness. The drill sergeant angrily pointed back to my seat, so I went back to sit, rubbing out the pain from my head’s point of impact.\n\n“WHY THE FUCK ARE WE HERE?” - he asked with seemingly impossible mixture of boredom and authority.\n“PRO VICTORIAM!” - the crowd answered.\n“WHERE THE FUCK ARE WE GOING?”\n“AD VICTORIAM”"

The guards seemed agitated, and their number decreased every day. The braver among us tried to ask what was going on and were beaten to a pulp for it. None of us expected that one day they would just leave.\n\nTheir departure didn't mean our torment would end, however. The Brotherhood left in a great hurry. You could tell they were terrified. 'They're even closer than we thought'; 'We don't have much time'; 'Evacuate all the personnel'. Some tried to escape with them, and they were gunned down without mercy. After that, most of us backed down. That gave them time to set up the explosives and detonate them near the entrance, sealing us inside.\n\n Many days have since passed in the dim electric light. All we've got were the spare rations the guards left in haste. We got water from the cave walls. We were sleeping and waking up with no idea if it was day or night. Most of us decided to finally rest and gave up mining since no one was watching us anymore. Those who had been here the longest kept on mining, fearing that the Brotherhood would return to punish them if they slacked. Most of us ridiculed them, at least initially. But as we stayed underground paranoia, anxiety, and hate against the Brotherhood grew. Some said they heard paladins marching in the deeper corridors of the mines. People down here were on the verge of savagery, contemplating eating the dead.\nSo when we heard a loud rumble outside, we all thought it was another of their crazy war machines. When the boulders blocking the entrance were slowly being removed, we deduced the Brotherhood came back to get us back to work. 'No chance I get back to mining after all this' one of us said. We were blinded by light after seeing the sunlight for the first time in a while, but we could see soldiers with flashlights coming down to us. With little thought, we threw stones at them and charged at them with pickaxes with our hands. I was one of the very first attackers. We were being shot at.

Those who don't have surely had the displeasure of hearing countless cautionary tales retold by their elders. For many, the dangers of nuclear energy are a personal experience carried for the rest of their lives, weaving themselves into the fabric of the nation's collective consciousness. The fear of Chernobyl and what it did to the surroundings and inhabitants of Pripyat has overwhelmed the public debate ever since, leading to the termination of the Żarnowiec Power Plant project and shutting the door on all further developments. This disaster taught the current populace just what harm the Atom may do to one’s body and how a simple human error can cause such a massive tragedy.\n\nThe disaster in Fukushima, where a reactor suffered a meltdown due to a tsunami further exacerbated the distrust, teaching the population that even the repeatedly touted safe, modern technologies, can easily break down when faced with the forces of nature. \n\nAnd lastly came the Bałuty explosion, the final nail in the coffin of our decaying nation. Many people lost their lives, their homes, their families... What remains of the old Bałuty district is nothing but a pile of rubble and pain - a poignent reminder of how the Atom may be used against them.\n\nAll those experiences have caused all but the most devoted of our citizens to dread the future presented by Jakub Wiech.

In fact, the duo in the car had almost no vision of what was happening outside their 'Wagen,' most of the cameras showing only what vaguely looked like a black cloud sinking in the all-encompassing grayness. \n\n- Yo, look. - Bartek detected some movement amongst the fires  - Something's happening. \n- Oh shit. Are they throwing fists? \n- I don't know, but it looks like something agitated the- \n-... \n- Oh bother. \n\nThe two overseers couldn't see what was happening outside, but they still could hear - and that *definitely* sounded like a gunshot, and the people outside seemed to agree, judging by the cacophony of blind semi-auto fire that opened up mere seconds later. Two clouds of people connected with each other, one quickly getting considerably smaller and smaller. \n- COMMAND! THE GUARDS OPENED FIRE! - shouted Kajtek \n- COMMAND! COMMAND! THEY'RE CHARGING US! CHARGING US! \nAs one of the groups dissipated in the fog, the duo braced themselves, opened up the car doors, and let their guns loose, whatever was in front of them be damned.

It had the potential to become one of the coveted symbols of the changes needed to convince society to collaborate for the future.\n\n- You know, it's a bit ironic considering your last name. Just imagine the headlines! Wiech and Węgiel! If Ziemkiewicz were here, he would grill me for weeks for this! - laughed the leader of the Atomic Crusade to his interlocutor, none other than Roksana Węgiel, formerly a member of the Carbonari - the Brotherhood's political youth organization. Like many others after the civil war, she found herself in the network of interests of the new state's decision-makers.\n\n- Don't even mention Ziemkiewicz to me. Think about what an old geezer you have to be to make me an ideal of his ideological fight just because I have this last name and not another! A bunch of boomers, nothing more - said Roksana. She did not strike as an indoctrinated but rather as a sensible girl. Ironically, it was precisely common sense that the Brotherhood's propaganda promoted, achieving the opposite effect in the case of the young singer.\n\n- No, I get it. Listen, you have this one cool song. Of course, all of them are great, but this one is specific. 'XXI wiek'. I think we need a bit of that energy in the country now. Hope that this century will be green, filled with hope, and the best humanity has to offer. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to use you as a means to an end. I just want to collaborate with you. Concert tours, without any imposed speeches, without legal hooks, you say and do what you want. Fair compensation. I wouldn't ask you to stand with any banners and promote my mug either. What do you think?\n\nRoksana looked at Wiech with interest. She was sharper than anyone might expect. But she could also assess the intentions of other people just as well. Back then, she had no choice. Now, she did, and it was a fair one. And an exit strategy at any moment. Normalcy returns to the scene.\n\n- My manager will call your office, and they'll work out the details - she said with a smile, waving warmly to Wiech as she walked away. He stood in the room, lost in thought for a minute. He didn't think that business dealings in post-collapse Poland could still be honest and pleasant."

Without just one of these factors, it cannot be considered a country. Jakub Wiech perfectly knows this, just as any Polish warlord who wishes to reunify Poland. While any statelet in the ruins of this once great country can guarantee the first three, foreign recognition can be granted to only one, as there can be only one Poland. Jakub knew he had to act fast. Conveniently, Sweden is soon to host the UN Summit on Climate Change and Environmental Problems. The ecologist decided to use the opportunity and attend it, representing Poland and trying to gain international recognition for his Atomic Crusade.\n\nEach delegation gathered in Stockholm, among them a stacked contingent of Polish representatives, led personally by Jakub Wiech. He entered the hall and sat in a seat that had been empty for years, causing a wave of wonder among the attendees. Eventually, it was time for Poland to speak from the central podium. The Crusader embellished his achievements, presenting himself as the leader of a movement that brought to justice one of the biggest polluters in the region (though no one recognized his name) and made a promise to transform Poland away from carbon and smog. He pleaded that he can only achieve his lofty goals if the international community recognizes his state as the sole legitimate government in the country. A lady standing front and center among the attendees burst into laughter upon hearing Wiech’s final words. She left her designated spot and walked straight to Jakub. The face of the world's environmentalist forces burst into a mad tirade. \n\n- How dare you speak about transformation when you still oppress those who fight for the climate. - she spoke to Wiech. - How dare you speak about change when you’re just going to replace carbon with the Atom. How dare you even attend this summit when you're nothing more than an upstart unelected warlord who only gained your position through the force of arms? You think you’re so different from the monster you try to make out of Ziemkiewicz, but to me, you're just the same.\n\nWith those words, any excitement that Jakub Wiech created with his speech died a painful death, and the humiliated leader was forced to leave Stockholm in shame."

He tried to remain poised, but no matter where he placed his sight, he sensed a dozen angry gazes piercing his very soul, sizing him up, looking for any signs of weakness. The seat was painfully uncomfortable, and the complimentary glass of water tasted drier than the desert sands. Time seemed to slow to a crawl, each tick of the old analog clock sending a pang of anxiety through his chest. He was their rightful leader, but in this hostile den of wolves, Wiech felt small, like a bug waiting to be squashed. For the first time in many years, he experienced an emotion he thought he’d long left behind - fear. He could sense his initiative slipping. He knew he had to do something. He cleared his throat, rising up to speak. He could still salvage this... but even now, he was outplayed. \n\nBefore he could open his mouth, a booming voice stopped Jakub Wiech in his tracks, its gruff betraying the experience of the man sitting on the opposite end of the long, round table. \n-Mr. Wiech, you know our position. We don't want this protest either. Just stop your atomic farce, and we'll be back on our workstations by tomorrow. \nThe man was spouting utter nonsense, but in these unique conditions, the grizzled unionist sounded so commanding, so authoritative. It was enough to make the journalist's years of media training irrelevant, reducing his prepared stump speech into incoherent blabber. \n-You see... you're forgetting... nuclear energy is important... we need to build the power plant... it's for the good of nature... \nSeeing Wiech stumble on his words was more than enough to further elevate the union leader's confidence, and the back-and-forth of increasingly frustrated demands met with progressively weaker explanations soon led to the negotiations turning into a one-sided shouting match. It was a blowout. The ecologist knew what was coming, but no matter how hard he tried he simply couldn't find his groove. Each accusation sent him further into a corner from which there was no escape until his adversary finally uttered the sequence of words Wiech feared from the beginning of the exchange. \n-So are you gonna stop insulting my intelligence with your half-arsed justifications and do the right thing for damn once? Either you do as we say and never even dare utter the word 'atom' again, or we're done here. \n-I'm sorry, I just can't do that. Please, if you would listen... There are plenty of applications that would positively... \nBut the rest of his words fell on deaf ears. One by one, the strike leaders rose from their seats and left. Only the defeated Jakub Wiech remained in the room, slumped in his chair, the silence hurting him more than the dozens of insults thrown at him in those past few minutes. Not even he remembers how long it took him to gather the strength to get back up on his feet."

atom_supreg.8.desc:  "An emmisary was walking through the halls of Hôtel du ministre des Affaires étrangères, 37 Quai d'Orsay, Paris 7e to visit the French minister of foreign affairs, Catherine Colonna. There would be nothing unusual about this fact if it wasn't for the costume the ambassador was wearing. Piotr Napierała, Wiechowite Poland's minister of war, was heading into the negotiations wearing a copy of Napoleon's uniform. Even with the official authorization of the Atomic Crusade's government, the guards weren't sure whether to let him in, while the press was simply delighted to see something so unusual to feed their latest news cycle. Those backward conservatives and reactionaries back home, such as that meathead Gadomski, may think he's a clown, but their worldview prevents them from seeing the genius of his method. The French government will be hard-pressed by local commentators to accept a proposal from someone who so ostentatiously compliments the French nation.\n\nTime passed, and Napierała was getting closer to his destination. Just in time! The German ambassador preceding him was just leaving the minister's office. Seizing the opportunity, the Polish envoy sent his regards to the German nation by... sticking out his tongue in contempt.\n\n When he finally entered the office, he greeted Mrs. Colonna with a handshake and a slight bow.\n - Bonjour, madame la ministre. - Showing off his proficiency in French, Napierała decided to hold the talks in his host's language.\n - Bonjour - Colonna responded politely - I was told you wanted to discuss military contracts and supplies in case of any unexpected attack.\n - Indeed - Napierała knew she was trying her best not to explicitly say the matter concerned the German threat. He decided to play along. - I hope you can understand us. France is looking kindly on our cause. It is to be expected, given it's the birthplace of modern, enlightened Western civilization. Poland also has a chance to rise to such an esteemed level if only it can protect itself from nations that are... a western-eastern civilizational hybrid at best.\nHe looked deep into the minister's eyes to make sure she knew the meaning of his words. She knew.\n - Well, our government holds the expectation for a contract for your weapons. As well as a guarantee of our independence coupled with a defensive alliance.\n - Monsieur Napierała - Colonna responded - I thank you for your kind words about our nation. It is true your cause for a clean environment is dear to our hearts. We will certainly let you purchase our weapons at a fair price, but I am afraid we cannot come to your aid in case of invasion. You have to understand: your government has far too little international legitimacy for us to do that. The best we can do is to sign a non-aggression pact.\nNapierała was clearly disturbed by this turn of events.\n - Thank you for what you have already promised us. - He tried to maintain his composure - But you must realize: Our country is young and already fatigued by ever-lasting struggle. We may collapse without substantial external help.\n - I am sorry, monsieur Napierała. There is nothing more we can do."

My buddy Jarek laid on the apartment to my left, watching the other street, featuring two more unlucky initiates made to hand out leaflets and stack manifestations. I was like them once, handing out pieces of paper that I barely understood and sticking my neck out for hooligans and anti-atom fanatics. But I’ve done my time, and as a spotter, I had to see danger coming before the field guys would.\n\n- The Atom is the future, not the past! - I heard Daniel’s voice. A few minutes passed and at last, he started making people take the leaflets. The leaflets improved too; rather than congesting physics lessons on one piece of paper, they showed the efforts we made at mastering the technology so that it would not fail us again. Convincing people right after what happened to Łódź was a challenge, but not impossible. Back when I was in the field, I didn’t have anyone watch over me. But I did have a sawed-off.\n\nHere a woman spits on Daniel, here’s some big bald guy looking weird... My eyes wandered away to scry the street... and way further I saw hooligan-like dudes, women among them... no, too thin and not butch enough to be football hooligans. But they did have baseball bats. Putting on bacalavas... I quickly produce my intercom and report: \n- W5, suspicious group approaching Daniel, ready yourselves. Daniel, get out of here now...\nToo late. As he walks away the group picks up the pace.\n- They’re on to him, intervene now!\n\n- Do you want us all to die? To suffocate like this whole city did once! - I could hear the so-called green activists accost Daniel. He pushed one back and got hit in the arm with the bat by another, he gave ground as one prepared to swing with her own bat. Another restrained him, but my eyes were on the biggest one, who stepped back on the streets... and drew a handgun.\n- My brother died in Bałuty! Why won’t you give HIM some of your...\n\nAn infernal screech resonated as a car hit the bandit in full force and stopped. Men in black vests and balaclavas poured out. That was our intervention team, finally responding to my alarms. Before the assailants knew it, nightsticks were on them, their arms, their heads. The blonde woman accompanying them screeched until one of us put a sack over her head and subdued her. The rest were writhing and kicking before also being pacified with the sacks and merciless blows. The biggest man, the one smashed by the car, crawled towards his gun, which one of ours casually took and cocked as if he was going to shoot him dead. Then he simply knocked him out with a stomp to the face.\n\nAnother day, another battle over hearts and minds won. Another day of joining the Crusade to change the world, only to end up a glorified spotter."

Years of work at the Climate Agency yielded few results and mentally drained everyone in the Supervision Department. Tomorrow, a meeting of all key personnel in the agency is scheduled, where a collective report on the state of the environment for this year will be presented. Professor quietly prayed that this time she would be able to tell everyone something more than just that there is still much to be done, and we need to be patient.\n\nShe reached for the first report. Environmental toxicology. Study of the mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of environmental pollutants. Ecotoxicological studies of air pollutants. Biomonitoring of water pollutants. All biomarkers show visible improvement! Could it be that our efforts are finally bearing fruit? Zielińska, with excitement, began to flip through the subsequent reports with the results of studies conducted on the Łódź ecosystem, which suffered the greatest damage. It looks like it really is getting better!\n\nThe second report. Studies of fauna populations in areas affected by an ecological disaster. Someone noticed wild boars near the Łask airport! Not long ago, it seemed impossible, even animals avoided the entire voivodeship with a wide arc, fish in the rivers were lifeless, and birds fell from the sky dead as if struck by lightning. Maybe one day when Zielińska wakes up, she will be greeted by the singing of skylarks? She briefly daydreamed about starting a farm in her hometown of Grabica. However, she promptly returned to reality and reached for another stack of papers.\n\nThe third report. Bioassays on plant organisms. The professor's heart raced with excitement; she couldn't hide her joy while reading the next sentences of the report. The rate of root growth, germination, and seedling growth, all in the plus! All samples of planted secale cereale, triticum aestivum, and hordeum vulgare met the standards sufficient to be considered healthy specimens!\n\nProfessor took off her glasses and stood up in amazement. She took a deep breath, for the first time not fearing that excessive inhalation could result in respiratory diseases. The leader of the Crusade himself will be at the meeting tomorrow, and she will be the one to convey the groundbreaking information - our ecosystem is healed. Of course, it will take a few more years before we reach the ideal state, but this is already a tremendous success. Zielińska won't sleep tonight, eagerly anticipating tomorrow."

Wielkie hale wypełnione bronią skrywały jednak nie święte granaty ręczne, ale coś co w obecnej sytuacji geopolitycznej przyda się o wiele bardziej.

I wtedy dopiero Mirek ujrzał absolutny gigantyzm zgromadzonych tu maszyn.\n\n- Rafał, co to do cholery jest? - zapytał Mirek wskazując palcem na stojący najbliżej ogromny czołg z dwiema lufami. Był imponujących rozmiarów ale nie wyglądał jakby miał gdzieś pojechać w najbliższej przyszłości.\n- To mój drogi jest prototypowy czołg który przejęli nasi gdy weszli do fabryk porzuconych przez Bractwo. Mówili na niego Koala. Trochę ich zdążyli naklepać, i nie wszystkie wysadzili. Jest jeden problem. To absolutny szajs.

Green terrorists would like to present themselves as a rational ecological faction, but after what they have done, there is no other choice but a full-scale pacification action.\n\nThe streets have turned into battlegrounds. Strikes are being violently broken up, but like a hydra, in the next town, new demonstrations appear, immediately turning into riots. There have been several cases of railway sabotage, one causing a train derailment near Radomsko leading to several dozens of casualties as it was not a freight train but a passenger one they hit. Once again, the bloody ideological struggle claims the lives of innocent bystanders.\n\nWhat differentiates an Islamic terrorist from an ecological terrorist? Perhaps nothing, it seems. They share the same color, and an incident in Skierniewice, where two ecologists blew themselves up together with a power transformer, showed that they are willing to die for their twisted beliefs. The fact that these beliefs are not inherently evil matters little. Taking care of the environment is a perfectly valid idea, one that we ourselves advocate. But according to Greenpeace, atomic energy is the tool of the devil, even though they don't believe in God. They see a speck in their neighbor's eye and look into the other eye, hoping to find more.\n\nThe climax of absurdity, however, was reached in Bełchatów. One of the wisest members of Greenpeace decided to strike at the den of evil. However, it can hardly compare to our operation during the civil war, where we neutralized entire power blocks. Quite exquisitely, this one ecologist decided to go to the power plant himself and, to the amazement of the guards, fired an RPG-7 grenade launcher at one of the cooling tower chimneys. We can only imagine his surprise when the projectile didn't even scratch the mighty structure. He didn't have time to recover from the shock, as the power plant guards decided to liberate him from his oh-so-ambitious life.\n\nGod forbid, if they were more competent, we could have real problems, and history would have come full circle ironically. Currently, they're just an unbearable pest, striking more at civilians than at us. Our administration will weather this storm, even though we have started to slightly sway from our positions."

The Crusade's leader headed to the far end of the hall, where several scientists and soldiers had gathered around a device. Upon seeing their superior, they stood at attention, and the leader of the scientists addressed the newcomer:\n- Sir, I’m glad to report that the project has been completed.\n- Dr. Tarkowski, it's good to see you in the service of justice. Tell me, how did you do it? I get the impression that the Brotherhood was very interested in this project - Wiech said.\n- Yes, but they didn't care about human lives, and the only thing we had were blueprints. We didn't have enough time to move on to building prototypes before our laboratory was attacked... I'm sorry, liberated. I didn't mean to... - the scientist blushed, trying to conjure up an impromptu apology.\n- Relax, doctor. You are no longer a cog in the ideological machine - Wiech reassured him.\n\nThe Atomic Crusade took guardianship over many scientists after the fall of the Brotherhood, who willingly switched sides to continue their research without immoral orders from above.\n- Yes... Thank you for the reassurance! The problem in our project was the graphene core. It was unstable, and we couldn't use anything else for ideological reasons. We could always make it run on steam, but that would be nothing but a mockery of engineering. Now, we have developed a new kind of atomic battery that powers the device without any problem! We called it the fusion core, and we will likely be able to apply it not only to this project but also to popularize it and introduce it for everyday use! It is absolutely safe and, above all, affordable and universal. Allow us to show you, sir! Sergeant, start the machine!\n\nThe crowd unveiled the object of interest. Behind them stood a suit of powered armor, on which one of the soldiers applied the fusion core and secured it. The steel armor unfolded, allowing the test subject to enter it with ease. Everyone waited impatiently for what would happen next. The sergeant, completely covered in armor, moved and took a step. And then another. And another, until, to everyone's surprise, he started running. The armor turned out to be fully functional. Wiech watched the entire scene with satisfaction.

Incydentów przygranicznych codziennie było przynajmniej kilka, ale na szczęście żaden z nich nie stał się zarzewiem otwartej wojny. Tym z góry zawsze udało się załagodzić sytuację. Wczoraj Niemcy symulowali utratę panowania nad łodzią i pustą krypą staranowali nasz patrolowiec. Na szczęście nikomu się nic nie stało. Dzisiaj rano od strony parku na południu usłyszeliśmy głośny wybuch. Szwaby wysadziły jeden z wałów przeciwpowodziowych po naszej stronie.Jak tak dalej pójdzie, jeszcze tydzień i zaczniemy w siebie strzelać ze wszystkiego co mamy. A biorąc pod uwagę ile sprzętu zgromadziliśmy po obu stronach, to i ze Słubic, i Frankfurtu nie zostanie kamień na kamieniu. \n\nWarta przebiegała w miarę spokojnie oprócz momentu w którym nad moją strażnicę nadleciały dwa małe drony cywilne. Mój towarzysz, szeregowy Wojtek otworzył ogień w kierunku jednego z nich niszcząc go, a drugi kołując wbił się bezpośrednio do jednego z namiotów na tyłach. Ci, których obudził nie pozostawili z niego nawet kabelka. Jutro chłopaki chcą wysłać balon na niemiecką stronę z głośnikiem grającym Rotę. Nie uważam żeby to był dobry pomysł, ale nie chcę donosić na kolegów…\n\nJeszcze trzy kolejne dni i zostanę zluzowany na tyły. Dowództwo stara się rotować frontowymi jednostkami jak najczęściej, rzekomo ze względów ogromnego stresu jaki na nas jest nałożony każdego dnia. W sumie mają rację, tego tylko brakuje żeby ktoś nie wytrzymał i zaczął pruć do wszystkich Niemców których widać. A widzimy ich często, w końcu są po drugiej stronie rzeki. A na moście stoimy praktycznie twarzą w twarz.\n\nMuszę napisać list do matki. Normalnie zadzwoniłbym ale ze względów bezpieczeństwa wszystkie urządzenia elektroniczne są ograniczone do sprzętu wojskowego. Tak bardzo chciałbym usłyszeć jej głos, zanim…\n…miejmy po prostu nadzieję, że góra wie co robi i nie będzie wojny. Już wystarczająco wycierpieliśmy."

atom_supreg.17.desc: "Gorąca linia pomiędzy Łodzią a Berlinem stała się wręcz parząca. Kataklizm wojenny może wybuchnąć w każdej chwili, jedna iskra może wysadzić tę całą beczkę prochu jaką stała się granica polsko-niemiecka. Dlatego też Jakub Wiech, rozumiejąc powagę sytuacji, każdą możliwą chwilę starał się spędzać na konsultacjach z kanclerzem Niemiec by rozbroić tę tykającą bombę. Ale to wszystko była syzyfowa praca. Niemcy wcale nie pomagali, wręcz wydawać by się mogło że celowo zaogniają konflikt by doprowadzić do otwartej wojny.\n\nWóz albo przewóz. Ale kiedy zdecydujesz się grać va banque, musisz mieć pewność że to ty będziesz w każdym momencie rozdawał karty. Wiech podniósł słuchawkę, rozkazał połączyć się z Berlinem oraz włączyć transmisję na żywo.\n\n- Halo, Herr Wiech. Czy to jest ten dzień, w którym odbierając telefon usłyszę sensowną propozycję od pana? - nastroje w Niemczech były podejrzanie wesołe\n- 17 bilionów złotych - wypalił Wiech\n- Że co, proszę?\n- 6 bilionów 220 miliardów złotych za okupację niemiecką w latach 1939-1945 - mówił ostro, ale powoli i wyraźnie z naciskiem na każde kolejne słowo - kolejne 5 bilionów za szkody wyrządzone w trakcie inwazji roku 2025, oraz dwa lata bezustannej germanizacji, kolonializmu i wyzysku. 5 bilionów 780 miliardów za szkody wyrządzone przez Energiewende całej Europie, oraz spowodowanie katastrofy klimatycznej na kontynencie. \n- To żart, ale dość słaby. Proszę do mnie nie dzwonić w innej sprawie niż zapraszam.\nWiech zagotował się. Ich ignorancja oraz wyższość to tylko pozory. Przycisnąć ich, a w końcu pękną. Nie są gotowi na to co im przyszykowaliśmy.\n- Jestem śmiertelnie poważny. Jednocześnie chciałem poinformować, że wszystkie wolne narody Europy wzywają reżim w Berlinie do rozwiązania Unii Europejskiej w jej obecnym kształcie. Nowa organizacja międzynarodowa zajmie jej miejsce, bez niemieckiego imperializmu. Dodatkowo macie 5 lat na zrezygnowanie z zatruwania środowiska poprzez zamknięcie wszystkich elektrowni węglowych. Zanim się jakkolwiek odezwiesz to wiedz, że stoją ze mną wszystkie uciskane państwa europejskie. Wy nie wiecie kim my jesteśmy, wam się tylko wydaje. Na koniec tylko powiem, że ta rozmowa transmitowana jest na całą Europę. I zwrócę się też do was, obywatele niemieccy. Zrzućcie jarzmo neoimperialnego oprawcy i wyzwólcie swój kraj. W innym przypadku spadnie na was gniew całego wolnego świata jeżeli spróbujecie jeszcze raz prowokować wojnę. Żegnam.\n\nWiech rzucił słuchawką nie czekając na odpowiedź i opadł wyczerpany na fotel. Serce mu biło jak szalone, w głowie pędziły mu setki myśli, ale jednocześnie czuł wielką ulgę. Nie wiadomo jaka będzie reakcja Berlina ale zabezpieczył sobie wszystkie możliwe wyjścia. Nie stoją sami przeciwko wrogowi. Po raz pierwszy od dawna dostrzegł światło w bardzo długim tunelu."

atom_plant.1.desc: "- And what is he doing here? - Czyżewski asked in an accusatory tone.\nWiech couldn't hope for even an ounce of civility during this meeting. Indeed, this could be a discussion that makes or breaks our state. The decision regarding which type of reactor will power our crusade.\n - Well... Gadomski is our minister of the economy. He has as much of a right to be here as you.\In theory, he should be the main hero of the discussion, but Wiech didn't want his old guard, that being Czyżewski and Byzdra, to feel sidelined by the newcomer and an ex-Brotherhood member at that. To balance out the scales, he decided to include Napierała in the meeting as well.\n - Karol, would you like to present the project you and Daniel have been working on?\nKarol Byzdra stood up and began his speech.\nBack when our organization was still underground, Daniel and I worked on planning the future of our power grid. You've all seen the papers, so I'll be brief. Small modular reactors seem, by far, to be the best option for powering our nation. We already have pre-Fall plans, and we know those kinds of reactors would allow us great flexibility when adding additional units. We could easily expand the power grid along our progressive reunification. Not to mention, we won't be nearly as susceptible to enemy attacks. A single large reactor would be the perfect target for anyone wishing to cripple our nation, as we have proven during our attack on Bełchatów. I hope the Great Ecologist will be inclined to implement our vision.\nGadomski raised his hand.\nIf I may, I have some issues with that proposal.\n - You may speak - Wiech waved his hand in an encouraging gesture.\n - I'd suggest a... more centralized system. A system that could be based on the existing infrastructure. A system that would give employment to the workers of current power plants. That would also be a major visible symbol of change, don’t you think?\n - A centralized system is a good idea - Napierała always had to have the last word - We could have far more control over a centralized grid. People here are too stupid to appreciate atomic power. We need a monumental symbol of nuclear dominance.\nA comprehensive discussion about the technicalities and details of those two visions ensued.\n - The decision is up to you as always, Great Ecologist. - Czyżewski summarized the lengthy debate."

atom_plant.2.desc: "The Great Ecologist stood huddled over his desk, poring through the most recent batch of documents - technical drawings, half-baked summaries, cost assessments... all pointing to one conclusion: the project was no better than a gamble, and he'd have to go all-in for even the slightest chance at pulling it off. He was in the fourth hour of searching for any possible improvements, desperately looking for a way to increase efficiency, his thoughts illuminated only by the faint glow of the dimly shining lamp. Wiech was in his element, constantly writing down notes as if in some atomic Zen state. \n\nLost in his thoughts, the journalist failed to notice Gadomski's presence up until the minister began his speech. His voice visibly startled Wiech, forcibly pulling him back into reality. \n- Look, I don't want to be too much of a bother, but there's no way you can go ahead with this. We're on our last legs when it comes to resources. You can have your reactor, but can't you wait until it doesn't risk bankrupting the entire country? \nEmboldened, Gadomski threw a hefty stack of economic reports onto the sturdy mahogany desk, the first page proudly blaring in flashy red ink: 'Critical Deficit Alert.' \nWiech glanced briefly at the neatly provided summary, pretending to genuinely consider his minister's warnings, but his mind had already been made. He was a visionary, and he wouldn't let matters as trivial as funding concerns hinder his dreams. \n- The decision has already been made, Witold. I'm not going to undo everything just because of some numbers on a sheet of paper. - Wiech replied in a bored tone. \nThe instinctive dismissal irritated Gadomski, betraying a hint of frustration behind his normally calm demeanor. \n- You're hitching our whole future on an idea that failed every single time it's been tried. Mark my words. When your passion project leads to us dying in some unnamed ditch, you better remember who tried talking some sense into you. \n\nBefore Wiech could respond, Gadomski had already exited the study, leaving the ecologist with only his thoughts as company.

And that’s precisely why we have to go down into these godforsaken tombs. We got the sorry task of going down one of the boarded-up tunnels that have been abandoned for, at the very least, what 60-something years now? Fucking amazing... \n\nCold air, wet floors, and the sloshes of galoshes, all lit up only by a mining helmet’s lamp. The freshly graduated engineer from Wrocław could not have dreamt of a more luxurious job to start off his résumé. \n- Quit complaining to that recorder, Miłosz, and help me with these fucking planks! You’re supposed to document our findings on that piece of junk. God knows how much more of your ramblings that thing can store! \nThe man he got pinned with for this on-the-job training was as close as one could get to the fresh-faced engineer's polar opposite - a gruff, 50-or-so-year-old miner from Lubin, picked to accompany him due to his decades of experience working for KGHM, which could’ve actually been useful if not for the greybeard’s cranky attitude putting Miłosz off from ever taking his advice seriously. \n- Alright, alright, no need to shout Lucjan. Pass me the crowbar. \n\nAlbeit with some struggles and a series of loud thuds, the rotted oak planks gave out, revealing the dusty, old section of the mine. Thus far, the area the pair had to go through was in a pretty rough state, but at least it still had somewhat working lights. However, in front of them, a solid black abyss stretched out for what seemed like infinity. Before Miłosz could make even a single comment about the dark tunnel, Lucjan pushed ahead, entirely unphased by whatever lay before them. \n\nMarching through the dank corridor, there really wasn’t much that the duo didn’t expect. Entirely unmaintained supports and rusted minecart tracks were a constant along their nerve-racking walk, but eventually, they stumbled upon a very curious find in the form of a minecart full of explosives. What was strangest about the discovery is that it did not seem to share the same style of markings as the rest of the equipment and signs around the facility. They looked too modern compared to the quaint fonts seen everywhere. Despite the confusion, they continued, noting the presence of the cart out of time. \n\nHowever, the planned expedition was abruptly cut short. Where the team expected the tunnel to continue, they found a cave-in and a putrid stench that unmistakably emanated from it. Investigating it closer, barely putting up with the smell, they found a thick rubber glove, out of which extended a rotting arm that vanished at the elbow beneath the rocks. It still had bits of rotting flesh left on it."

It smelled of 1970s machinery that he somehow kept operational and pigshit, but mostly pigshit. \n- Actually, no permit was given by the local government. None was needed. Your lands will be compensated for with a derelict parcel in another part of the country. \n- The bureaucrat's official tone and entourage caught the farmer’s attention, who stood up and walked over to try to stand up to him. "N-O!” - he yelled. \n- There ain’t any uranium in this whole country, so just forget it! - he continued, but conventional wisdom was no match for the Crusade. \n- There’s up to 600ppm in organic phosphorites here... - The Wiechowite begun. \n- So you’re telling me you’re taking MY farm because you want to extract uranium from underground shit? - The farmer cackled. \n- I’m saying if Brother Wiech wants to build a Ferris wheel here, then this farm is getting turned into a Ferris wheel! We’ll pay for the renovation and relocation, now what else do you want? \n- I want... one million euros! - The farmer’s thus far abrasive speech turned into a strange howl, part wolf, part alarm. \nDeep sigh. He could work with that. Steep but acceptable. But then the old man grinned, showing his half-black set of teeth. \n- Okay, sorry, I misspoke. One hundred... BILLION euros! - he then proceeded to smugly scratch his teeth with his finger. \n- That’s it, guards, take the geezer out of my sight - The bureaucrat was done with the boomer’s antics. The whole rotten building would have to go down; nothing could be repurposed. But once the boomer and his pigs have been moved, he could actually get to work. He might even get him some new farming machinery, as watching the old man writhing and yelling as he was taken to the paddy wagon made him feel a sense of compassion. But still, he took out his measurement tools and started running around the rocks and the field: the excavation plans had yet to be confirmed and tweaked. Open-pit mine or not, he needed space for very thorough processing in order to cough out any uranium at all."

Since both French and Canadian opinions on this matter were uncertain, getting them on board became a rather delicate matter. Ludwik and Karol knew what had to be done. While the first was tasked with dealing with the French, the latter was assigned to the Canadians.\n\nKarol’s first step was to host a banquet in Łódź, to which he personally invited the Canadian ambassador. He was a bit unsure about the plan, but could not think of any different way. To his surprise, Canada accepted the invitation, sending a diplomatic corps to Łódź. He knew this event must be perfect and that they must show their best side to their esteemed guests. \n- The menu must have Polish national dishes! Why would they eat something they have available at home? - He screamed at his cook.\nAs the banquet was being buttoned up, Karol thought of one last touch to spice up the occasion - Vodka.\nThe guests arrived, the event went well, and the diplomats seemed more than pleased about it, though it could've just as well been the alcohol talking. Karol decided to use the opportunity and took the Canadian Ambassador to the balcony to discuss the deal.\n- Look, we are in a dire situation. We promised to transform our power plants but before we can dig up any resources, we also need to import some. I know your country has lots of uranium for...\n- Charles - The ambassador interrupted - I understand this is a crucial matter for you, and you have been given a mission, but I'm also operating according to directives from my higher-ups. In other words... they don’t trust your movement. You are just merely a warlord in this rabble and it’s not even certain whether you will survive. C'est la vie. The banquet was great though, I must admit.\n\nKarol was scared to return to Wiech with nothing, especially after spending so much on a pointless event. As he entered the Foreign Office, his heartbeat got faster. He sat in his seat, stressed and pale.\n- Mr. Wiech, I... I... the Ambassador...\n- Don’t worry, I know about everything. - Wiech interrupted - It doesn’t matter anymore; Ludwik secured a deal with the French. They will sell us Canadian and Nigerien uranium. At least you helped us open relations with the Canadians.\nAs Karol left the room, he breathed a massive sigh of relief.

Even half-asleep, he could perfectly tell his plane was approaching Windhoek through the sheer level of turbulence alone. He could swear the old Boeing was about a minute away from crumbling to pieces, and that single thought did more to keep him awake than the uncomfortable headrest and the chair in front of him constantly crushing his knees. The entire journey, he desired nothing except to throw himself onto the nearest bed and sleep off his nightmarish travel. But when the Polish envoy finally set foot on the poorly kept runway and saw an entire delegation chanting his name, he thought he was already dreaming. \n\nThe red carpet, a marching band triumphantly blaring the hymn of the host nation, a slew of praise from a man styling himself as the minister of Mines and Energy - all of that only helped exacerbate the sleepless diplomat's headache. He quickly popped two pills of Ibuprofen, before being reluctantly dragged into a government vehicle along with the entourage. The next three hours had been a blur. Instead of the expected short tour around the capital, the drive continued, piercing the surrounding savanna in some unknown direction. Courtesy demanded Artur actually spend the time conversing with the official doubling as the local guide, but, in his haze, the best he could do was limit himself to memorized propaganda phrases. \nWhen the Rössing mine appeared suddenly before his eyes in all its glory, Artur was sure he'd crossed the border between reality and hallucinations. It was larger than anything he'd seen before, dwarfing even the might of the open pits of Bełchatów. Following a brief walk around the excavation area under the full force of the desert sun, clearly meant to impress the ambassador more than anything, the group headed to an unassuming shack serving as the complex's operational center. \nBelieving he had sufficiently softened up the envoy, the minister went on the offensive, probing the staggering diplomat for any possible concessions. \n-You know, Mr. Zawadzki, the Namibian government would gladly work with your nation, but I'm sure you're aware of the situation up north. If the rebels push any further, they could cut our export routes. We need you just as much as you need us. \n-Oh... well, why don't you just... push them back? - Artur replied in his dreamlike state, only partly registering the words said to him. \n-We'd love to do that, but we don't have nearly enough guns to break the stalemate. Our last offensive has already put us on the back foot. \n-Guns... we've got some guns... we can share... \n-Thank you, Mr. Zawadzki, that would mean the world to us. I'll go get the papers ready. \n\nIt took no more than five minutes of hurried scribbling for the delegation to return with the finished agreement. The document was chock-full of errors, something a distinguished diplomat like himself should have immediately noticed, yet as Artur pretended to read the numerous terms and stipulations about covert weapon shipments, all he could focus his eyes upon was the signature box. Going through the text of the treaty in record time, he inscribed his name on the bottom, officially bringing it to life. Satisfied, Artur collapsed onto the desk, drifting off to sleep before the minister could even start celebrating."

When she arrived, other members of Greenpeace were already there. She quickly joined the group and held a banner with the writing 'Wiech = Ziemkiewicz' on it. Other protesters had similar placards, either comparing Wiech to Kaczyński, the Sheikhs, or Trump. They quickly formed a blockade on the road leading to the Vistula Split. There were many Natural Reserves in the area, the most important of which was the Landscape Park. Greenpeace protesters quickly adopted the cormorant as their symbol. All this to protect them from the exploitation plans of Wiech. The protests spread around the area, with blockades forming on the roads from Gdańsk, Nowy Dwór Gdański, and Elbląg. \n\nMarzena was overwhelmed by the reaction of the populace. However, their intentions did not match hers.\n- This will ruin tourism in the area. - The director of the Panorama Recreation Center said.\n- His politics are just pure nonsense. Kaczyński would never do that. - An elderly woman stated.\n- Cormorants are as black as coal, and he stole this treasure from us. - A local seller screamed.\n- The Atom is not even healthy, wouldn’t mining it here poison the air? - A pedestrian asked.\n- I just want a day off work today. - Julia, a worker of Panorama said.\n\nThe protesters, however, were soon met with the reaction of Wiech. The police, alongside a small regiment of the Crusade, entered the cities and started to disperse the protests. As they came, most of the rioters fled, and only Greenpeace members remained. They were given an ultimatum: either they yield, or they will be arrested and tried. Some surrendered, and some, like Marzena, did not yield. As such, something thrown by one of the guards quickly hit her in the head, and she woke up in a police car on her way to the station. Through the small windows of the patrol vehicle, she saw a swarm of Cormorants, fleeting away from the Split. She knew she failed, and the work had begun."

Nobody would bother visiting the area unless they had a specific purpose, and so a place such as this was largely left to its own devices. \n\nWith any unknown traffic consisting of beaters driven by lost wanderers, Marcin could hardly contain his confusion at the sudden sight of a pristine black sedan. The model was unlike anything he'd ever seen before - a marvel of engineering that the war-torn country simply couldn't produce. It had to belong to someone important. He closely followed the car during its entire drive through the village, wondering if it was a sign of better things to come. He chalked it up as a fluke, but he soon found himself wishing he'd chased it out when he had the chance. \n\nLife in Central Podlaskie had a certain rhythm, like a meandering river with its course set over hundreds of years of undisturbed isolation. Yet, in the tiny hamlet of Rajsk, the flow had encountered a rock that turned it into a turbulent stream. Though Marcin knew it not, his home stood at the crossroads of history, and he was to be one of the victims of progress. \n\nLess than a week after the first sighting, the car returned. A short, spectacled man emerged from it, ignoring all questions, drawing a detailed map of the village, scribbling some unknown remarks, and filling out heaps of documents. The next day, a construction crew showed up, coupled with an armed escort. A massive bulldozer entered Marcin's property, readying itself to deliver a blow that would destroy the villager's livelihood. He rushed out of his home just in time to watch it collapse as soon as the wrecking ball made contact, screaming and shouting at the official until his lungs gave out. \n\nThe assurances of a new, state-provided home made no difference, neither did the hefty sum of money offered as compensation for this wanton use of eminent domain. Every word said by the official served only to further enrage Marcin, and after a brief moment, the spat quickly turned to blows. A splatter of red stained the bureaucrat's perfectly ironed flannel - the last sight of victory the villager saw before a peacekeeper's baton put him to sleep."

atom_plant.12.desc: "If an office had fully working heating, lighting and didn’t look like Pripyat at night, one could consider it luxurious. This former town hall was once such a magnificent office. Offering little in manpower or relevant resources, its location meant it was the perfect place to induct new hires. My room was the biggest one. Must have been the mayor’s at some point. My job was simple and disproportionately vital: Respond to the hundreds of job ads we’ve placed worldwide. From America to China, we’ve been trying to recruit nuclear engineers and physicists to train our own cadre of experts. The SMRs weren’t going to maintain themselves. The problem is: At the zenith of the civil war, there just weren’t that many, or rather any remotely qualified experts daring enough to enter a warzone. Forget safety: Could we even guarantee them comfort? Internet access? Things they’d never imagine life without? We’d definitely have to pay them in euros or dollars, which posed a whole other challenge.\n\nMy very first interviewee entered. A blonde man who looked part scientist, part stand-in for Guy Fieri. We had a chat about where he was from. The most I got about his background is that he’s... fantastic.\n- So, remind me again. Why did you apply for this job?\n- They were going door to door asking if anyone knew any scientists. I said: look no further.\n- Do you have any education in theoretical physics?\n- Why, I have a theoretical degree in physics! It’s fantastic, like me! I have it right here.\nThe sorry piece of gnarly-looking paper he showed me was decisively not fantastic. Naturally, I did not say welcome aboard.\nIf I want to keep my fancy office, I need to start producing recruits, and fast. Hope burned bright when I got a response from Korea. A relatively young nuclear engineer looking for work. Degree checked out, top of her class, shining letters of recommendation. Somehow, no job for six months now. Actually willing to travel to Poland of all places... learn the language...\nWas it too good to be true?\nNo matter. Mere two weeks later, she finally arrived at my office. When she entered, she was looking around the office as if she hadn't ever seen one in her life. She motioned her hands like a symphony conductor... Only then did she fully enter, still looking around, seeming surprised. What’s her deal? What was she expecting?\n\nWe spoke in English. What little she knew of Polish was astounding, given what little time she had to learn it, but her tone was strangely monotone. She just fired off syllables like a typewriter. I sometimes found it hard to follow what she was saying, despite us sharing a language.\n- What experience do you have working with SMRs?\n- As a KHNP intern, I demonstrated mastery of SMR maintenance. I installed, configured, and troubleshooted autonomously. You can review my recommendations.\nThere was no eye contact.\n- Why not stay with KHNP after graduation? Top marks at Seoul National... surely they begged you to accept their offer.\n- They did. I stayed there for about seven months.\n- Why leave…. you know what, forget it. Truth is, with a credible degree, you were always going to get the job. We’ll give you a call about your first assignment soon."

Nowadays, they don’t seem nearly as impressive when compared to modern complexes.\n\nBut we marvel at them relative to human abilities back then. Now that Poland’s civilizational might is in the gutter, the ability to convert a huge power plant all on our own seems like a gargantuan feat. But this won't be such a tale. Just like the Colosseum was built using ancient technology, so, too, will we achieve our goal despite our shortcomings.\n\nOur own grand project, the Bełchatów Nuclear Power Plant. A triumph over the past of running our planet into the ground.\n\nI, a Wiechowite, was once a boogeyman, a fairytale to scare the Brotherhood into submission. From a specter, I became the country’s new hope. I had to. I wanted to. The country had to be saved, not from poverty, not from war… from despair. That is the worst part of every downfall. Despair, like fear, is a killer that paralyzes both mind and body, inviting death and apathy. But the worst thing you can do is nothing. Like a predator constricting around you and preventing you from fleeing, crushing you harder and harder the less you struggle. Like a black hole; past its event horizon.\n\nProjects like this are huge, concrete reminders to conquer fear. Let it perforate through you and leave you behind. When all seems lost, when you can do nothing, sometimes you need a little piece of comfort to know that you can, in fact, do something. That Poland is not yet lost.\n\nBut for this example to shine, the plan must work. It is all about power, the power of the Atom. We are prepared. We have to be prepared. If anything goes wrong, but we manage to fix it before it becomes a serious problem, we have done a good job. Bełchatów will feed us energy without suffocating us. It has to. We gathered every nuclear engineer we could find, and then some, stocked up on uranium, adjusted the grid… it will work. It has to work.\n\nTime will tell if we end up having to go back to the drawing board or whether we can manage to light an atomic beacon of hope for the entire nation.

The very same Bełchatów you once had your men liberate from the Brotherhood's grasp. If anything, you should be proud, Karol. You made it all possible. \n-Yeah, I've seen the city enough times to know not to return. You should too. There's nothing but death and misery down those parts. Literally any place would be better than placing your... OUR magnum opus in the shadow of that hideous, smoke-spewing power plant. \n-Oh, about that... I thought Piotr already clued you in. We're not building it next to the power station; we're placing it inside the complex. Well, I guess 'replacing' would be the better word... \n\nThe ecologist could see his minister's face flushing red with anger, contorting into an unholy mixture of a thousand emotions about to explode as one. He considered flinching to put some distance between himself and the increasingly furious interlocutor, but all he could manage was a brief look of amazement. \n-What the hell are you thinking? Oh sure, put it in the middle of Bałuty while you're at it. Or build it in the fucking sea. No, you know what? Why not just chuck it over the German border? I'm done. If you want to put this country in the ground, you better do it your own damn self. I'm not risking my life and reputation for this mess. \n\nHaving exhausted his tirade and burned the bridge with his superior, Byzdra promptly stormed off towards nowhere. As Wiech stood there, bemused, another of his advisors quickly ran up to him with a stream of apologies. Panting, Daniel Czyżewski attempted to plead his colleague's case: \n-Jakub, I'm so sorry.

The immense potential of this project was utterly squandered by the People’s Republic’s lack of initiative.

He woke up every morning to till the fields, came back after sundown, drank a beer or two in front of his old TV, and off to bed he went. Sometimes, he even went out of his way to socialize with the village community. Can't look like too much of a loner, after all. The unassuming farmhand carefully crafted his life story to be so boring that nobody even thought to question his sudden appearance all those years ago. Everyone just assumed they simply forgot. \nFor his own safety, Andrzej hid a resume that put him at the center of the Atomic Crusade's attention - a fact that hit him like a brick wall when his evening program was interrupted by the doorbell's ring. He ignored it at first, but when the sound repeated, he reached for his stashed pistol and prepared for the inevitable. Watching every step, he made his way towards the front door before swinging it open, pointing the live weapon directly at the unknown assailant. \nOver the many sleepless nights, Andrzej often imagined the moment his past would come back to haunt him. A stream of images flashed before his eyes - the burning wreck of Maria, the tribalistic chants of the Wawer militants, the spear that landed inches from his body during his hurried flight... The engineer knew that one day they'd find him and finish the job. He expected to see a brute clad in full body paint. Instead, the man at the other end of the barrel was just another terrified egghead. \n-Please, lower your weapon. I don't want to harm you. You're Andrzej Bartczak, right? Chief Engineer of the Maria reactor? \n- Who sent you? - replied the 'farmer,' slowly lowering the muzzle \n- I'm Junior Engineer Przeworski. I'm supposed to work under your tutelage in Bełchatów. Wiech is constructing a nuclear power plant, and your expertise would be invaluable, sir. \n- So what? You want me to stick my neck out and preside over another burning wreck? I have a lesson for you, kid. Run for safety while you still can. \n- Is this really what you want you want your life to amount to? Best nuclear expert in all of Poland, and you're languishing in a countryside hut like some weak-minded simpleton? \nThe words must have struck a chord, as the engineer replied, gritting his teeth: \n- Fine, but if anything goes wrong, I'll be the first one out of there. \n- Great, I'll have the transport ready in an hour.
