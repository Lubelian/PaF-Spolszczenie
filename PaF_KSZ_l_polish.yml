unification.88.desc:0 "To the disdain of Polish nationalists, the Kashubian people refuse to lay down and die. With the minority tying its fate to that of the German invasion, serving the occupiers as a Eurokommissariat, it seemed that the collapse of foreign authority all around the nation was the death knell for Kashubia, as insurgents quickly made plans to march on the capital of Wejherowo. Instead, the resolve of the loyalists prevailed, as all dangers to their survival have now been eliminated from the voivodeship. Led by the aging Jan Wyrowiński, the state attempts to create a true multicultural society in which both Kashub and Pole can live together in peace. So far, the unsuccessful revolt demonstrated the fruitlessness of their attempts, but with their authority now fairly asserted, perhaps a country of equals is closer to reality than previously believed."
