POLITICS_DONALD_TUSK_DESC:0 "What was it all for? Dla Polski? Surely he hadn’t made things here better. Für Deutschland? All he did was tie ball and chain to its legs. Pour l’Europe? Isn’t its unity a mockery now? \n\nDonald Tusk would think himself as a descendant of Charlemagne and Napoleon – a humble one, but a descendant nonetheless. His impulse to strive to become the helmsman of European unity were his mixed Kashubian-Polish-German orgins, his obstacle – Poland. Grounded in country with one foot outside of Europe, he tried all his life to place them both firmly on the grounds of liberty, democracy and tolerance – first as an liberal oppositionist, then as the Civic Platform leader, a prime minister, a President of the European Council, finally as the providential man of anti-PiS opposition. Only when the crisis loomed large, he found his weapon, liberalism, rusty and in need of reforging. But it was too late. He failed. \n\nTusk was considered by Brussels and Berlin to be an ideal leader for Poland brought forcefully to European fold. At home among strangers, he became a stranger among his own. A Wallenrod at best, a Judas and Antichrist at worst, he can’t count on any support from the indigenous population. His authority stems from German tanks’ barrels, and thus he finally became the man he was potrayed by PiS: a marionette enforcer of the Eurofascist despotism. \n\nAll is not lost however. Despite all and everything, Tusk is still Polish – even if no one, including himself, would like him to be. He has been tied for life to this abnormal land. Time will tell if his ambitions will suffice to transform it."

EKW_paper_tiger_desc: "Donald Tusk. \n\nOnce a President of the European Council, now a mere commissar, who must fight constantly with other ambitious politicians to stay in his position. He, who was supposed to be the sole ruler and architect of Wespolen’s fate, faces threat from every side. His power is feeble, his support dwindles with each passing day. \n\nA lesser man could accept a failure like this one, but Tusk is not a such man. He has seen too much and gone too far to stand down. All his foes and fake allies underestimate him, thinking he has boxed himself into a corner. True, Tusk’s charisma might have been devalued, but his wit is still cunning."
EKW_kraut_wolves_desc: "German – pardon me, European – military relegated to assist us in our task of stabilising and securing Poland is not much of a help. Quite the opposite: generals Laubenthal, Lindner, Riechert and von Sandrart formed yet another "Gang of Four" in attempt to undermine authority of the Commissar and turn Westpolen into a fully-dependent German puppet in order to kickstart their own political careers. They wait for the appropriate moment to strike into Tusk’s authority and depose of him completely, while disregarding all orders. \n\nTheir hubris went too far. We should see that it becames their downfall.
EKW_security_reports_desc: "Murders, attacks on supply lines, partisan terrorist attacks. You call it a mess – I call it Wednesday. \n\nOur Eurokomissariat is in a state of anarchy. Polish, German and God-knows-whose paramilitaries roam the realm, behaving like they own the place (for truth be told, they really do). Due to decrepit state of our military, we hardly can counter any of them. However, this might not be necessary. \n\nThe inept and improvised nature of these bands combined with lack of resistance has made them overconfident and careless. We can easily track their movements, pinpoint their bases and find out their weakness. This information will be a secret tool that will help us in the future..."
EKW_building_authority_desc: "Instead of trying to extinguish the fire with a plastic egg filled with water (you know, the one they use on Śmigus Dyngus) and overstretch our militia, we should pull back all the resources and equipment we still control and concentrate it in the west, where the partisan activity is lowest. Similarily all forces still loyal to Comissar, except for small squads of observers, should fall back and form a redoubtable, well, redoubt to protect however little we still have, for reinforcements are unlikely. \n\nThe lamps are going out all over Westpolen and we shall not see them lit again... who I am joking, of course we’ll going to see them lit again, it ain’t that bad! Right?"
EKW_carrot_and_stick_desc: "Once we have compiled the raport on Polish partisans, we should send it to our dear German „friends" and suggest where they should strike to cripple the resistance. The Gang of Four should be more than happy to extend their control over Polish hinterland and thus become the actual leaders of the Eurokomissariat. \n\nLittle would they know we would clandestinely support the resistance factions with intel on the German forces’ whereabouts and supply lines. Thus both sides should soon cripple themselves in a bloody struggle. \n\nUtmost discretion is necessary for this plan to succeed."
EKW_the_only_righteous_desc: "Our overlords in Berlin must not know how dire the situation is. We should call and reassure them we’re working closely with our German and Polish allies to counter hostile operations. Concentrating of our forces in the west would of course be a part of it. We shall lie as much as it is possible to buy us more time."
EKW_my_dear_desc: "We do not have many friends. Germany despises us and begins to lose trust in us, while Eurorepublics try to distance themselves from us. The one man Tusk might count on is his party colleague, associate and former subordinate, Comissar of Silesia Grzegorz Schetyna. Although they had some misunderstandings back in the days, for past few years they’ve found themselves in equally similar – and increasingly miserable – situations. Schetyna should well know that if he won’t lend Tusk his support, they’ll both end up literally devoured by the Polish populace or snuffed out quietly in Berlin. Once we’ll solidify control over Westpolen, we should be able to return favour."
EKW_chaos_in_the_east_desc: "The fire is set. Partisan activity skyrocketed, and German counterinsurgent operations run amuck. Chaos is ubiquitous. We should bunker up in our redoubt and watch for the opportune moment to strike."
EKW_warning_from_berlin_desc: "Per the last intelligence raport from Berlin, it seems like few extremist organisations are trying to invade Westpommern coastline. This is a favourable outcome. Most of German forces are supplied by sea due to high partisan activity in the hinterland. We’ll hope these wannabe vikings or D-Dayboos will catch Riechert and von Sandrart – as Poles use to say – with their asses to the wind."
EKW_va_banque_desc: "We've received information a large contingent of Schetyna's Polish troops is preparing to march northwards to assist us. We must not tarry and mobilise our forces at once. Once these forces cross our border, we'll strike at exhausted Poles and Germans alike, and trap them in a pincer movement."
EKW_kommissariat_on_fire_desc: "We've been preparing for the offensive too long for our plans to remain uncompromised. We cannot wait an hour longer, lest the grand plan will fail. Our troops shall move east at once. The war on bandits and troublemakers has begun. \n\nOnce Schetyna attacks, everything will be all right."

Śląsk upadł jako pierwszy, z fragmentami zdezorganizowanych Niemiecki sił na Śląsku okrążonych przez buntujących się Polskich frakcji, które teraz zaczynają cementować swoje rządy nad ziemiami, które były kontrolowane przez Bundeswehra, ale teraz Zachodnia Polska również zaczęła się dezintegrować, kiedy różni watażkowie wzywali swoich lojalistów do broni przeciwko UE, drogi są zajmowane przez bandytów, Europejskie siły wycofują się, by przegrupować się na Niemiecko-Polskiej granicy, żeby mogli uniknąć bycia za rojonymi ze wszystkich stron tak jak ich Południowi towarzysze i Niemieccy osadnicy formują milicję, by chronić swoich nowych domów i własności przed „Polskimi uwstecznionymi Draniami”. Pomimo zagrożenia całkowitego załamania wojska, Polacy radują się na lewo i prawo, kiedy w końcu dostali szansę, by wykuć nowe państwo ich snów, wolni od hegemonii Europy oraz PIS-u."

unification.54.desc:0 "Order reigns once again in West Pomerania. EKW authorities, led by the discredited former opposition leader Donald Tusk, have proclaimed they are once again in full control of the region. Few believed that the rump state would be able to hold its ground in face of overwhelming Polish resistance and abandonment by most European forces, let alone regain lost territories. The rightful masters have, however, prevailed in battle and now they once again stand tall over their Polish subjects. \n\nCareful observers have noticed that the Eurokomissariat, having done most of the fighting with its own amalgamation of Polish-European forces, has gained significant independence during their campaign. Now Tusk is, in fact, the sole ruler of this piece of Poland, a fact that scares many Poles and many Europeans as well to the bone. It is very likely that Tusk's ambitions, having been emboldened even more, will drag his domain into a new Drang nach Osten."
