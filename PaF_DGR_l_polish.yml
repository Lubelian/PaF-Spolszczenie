 DGR_faction_desc: "Securing power in the city wasn't as easy as it was in General Secretary's mind. Dozens of minor factions were squabbling between themselves after the Fall, fighting for scraps of once prosperous city in the region. Most of them were simply gangs and raiders, but there are also some ideological groups of fanatics. Remnants of Dąbrowa Górnicza local parliament were disbanded and forced to flee before some bandits could hang them up on the nearest lantern. They've found a shelter in Katowice Steelworks, biggest complex of this kind in the whole Poland. But factory was already controlled by Communist Party of Poland, and so they unexpectedly have gained a leadership over Dąbrowa's legitimate government, and it was up to them to bring order in the city."

 DGR_OL_instigate_workers_desc: "Coke Plant 'Przyjaźń' (polish for 'Friendship') is the second-largest facility of this type in Poland. The workforce there will definitely align with our side if we can encourage them...appropriately."
 DGR_OL_convoy_to_cargo: "Send armored convoy to PKP Cargo"
 DGR_OL_convoy_to_cargo_desc: "PKP Cargo in Strzemieszyce is a very important freight hub for supplies; we can't just leave it in the hands of the rebels. Fortunately, the railway from Huta Katowice leads straight to the station. All we need to do is send them a Trojan train."
 DGR_OL_cutoff_s1: "Cut off the S1 Expressway"
 DGR_OL_cutoff_s1_desc: "The S1 Expressway cuts through our city in half, with us effectively separated from the main urban area. Moreover, by controlling the interchange at Sulno, we will be able to follow National Road 94 through all of Strzemieszyce. And if we happen to gain control of the micro-steel mill and fuel tanks in the process? All the better."
 DGR_OL_march_on_basilica: "March on Strzemieszyce Basilica"
 DGR_OL_march_on_basilica_desc: "It's time to settle the score with the rebels from the Strzemieszyce People's Republic. Let our popular action be the final act in the history of Strzemieszyce separatism and put an end, once and for all, to their dreams of seceding from Dąbrowa Górnicza!"
 DGR_OL_disband_organisations: "Disband social and political organizations"
 DGR_OL_disband_organisations_desc: "Each of the rebels will be brought before a people's court and will not escape punishment. All non-communist organizations will be immediately dissolved by decree, and their members sent for compulsory reeducation. Such is the will of the people."
 DGR_OL_emergency_conscription: "Emergency conscription of Strzemieszyce workers"

 DGR_OW_send_armored_convoys_desc: "National Road 94 leads us straight through the heart of Sławków. Convenient, isn't it? All we need to do is send a few armored vehicles down this road to take control of the entire city. There will be no resistance"
 DGR_OW_arrest_separatists: "Arrest separatist leaders"
 DGR_OW_arrest_separatists_desc: "Sławków reactionary bandits, only mistakenly referred to as an army, fled to the Euroterminal, leaving the city to its fate. Interestingly, the dignitaries behind the civilian part of this rebellion were not informed of the retreat, so it's time for some spring cleaning!"
 DGR_OW_teach_them_lesson: "Teach them a lesson"
 DGR_OW_teach_them_lesson_desc: "The assault on the Euroterminal may prove to be a bloody undertaking. But this blood is necessary for the rebuilding of our city; the wealth amassed there will allow us to rise from our knees, and unlocking the freight route will finally enable our development.

 ## Events ##
 dgr_district.1.t: "District Wars"
 dgr_district.1.desc: "Can a so-called government that controls only one district have any legitimacy to govern the entire city? Dąbrowa Górnicza is a highly conflicted place, if not one outright in a state of anarchy. Gangs constantly terrorize people, holding them in an iron grip while fighting among themselves, for control of one or two more already devastated buildings. Huta Katowice has become the last bastion of municipal administration, and it has been taken over by the Communist Party of Poland. How desperate must a person be to decide to hand over power to a group of geriatric dinosaurs from a bygone era? Marcin Bazylak had no choice. Well, he had a choice, but he probably would have ended up hanging from a lamppost in Haller’s Park. So, he decided to make a pact with the devil and establish a government of municipal unity in the most powerful steel combine in all of Poland - Katowice Steelworks.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone agrees with this decision, and in the industrial heart of Dąbrowa Górnicza, the government managed to gather fewer than a thousand supporters. Can such a small number of soldiers subdue a city of over a hundred thousand? They will definitely need help and skillful maneuvering between the gangs. It's time to divide and conquer."

 unification.14.desc: "In an unexpected turn of events, a little dictatorship from Dąbrowa Górnicza managed to conquer their surrounding territories. Surrounded by more powerful enemies, it held on, and thanks to the Katowice Steelworks and the power of industry it prevailed against the early onslaught, conquering Jura.\nThe strange combination of communism and nationalism has proved to be stable and effective so far. It is not entirely clear what the relations between individual factions are, but taking into account their morale - we cannot count on an imminent end to this pact of two devils.\nThe People's Front of Zagłębie (as was their official name) now has at its disposal the untamed industrial power of the Dąbrowa Basin. It would seem that they will hit Silesia next, but unofficial sources seem to report that their eyes are focused on Lesser Poland."

 unificationreg.14.t: "[GetNewspaper]National People's Army unifies Lesser Poland"
 unificationreg.14.desc: "Lesser Poland has chosen socialism over death, though the decision wasn’t exactly free and unanimous, as shots can still be heard around Wawel Castle and in the wilderness of the Tatra Mountains. Still, it has become clear that with their resolute determination to liberate every workplace (especially heavy industry such as steelworks), National Bolshevik troops have triumphed everywhere from Przemsza to Dunajec. Fire blazes from the furnaces once more, along with the spirit of communism aided by nationalist rhetoric.\n\nHowever, reports emerge of a spike in internal disputes, as not all communists wish to adhere to the bloody ideological legacy of Mieczysław Moczar, and even fewer nationalists want to continue to cooperate with those advocating for the same communist ideology that enslaved the country for nearly 50 years. Despite this, heavily funded propaganda aims to temporarily reassure the citizens, but the first cracks are beginning to appear on this grand hybrid project."

 unificationsupreg.14.desc: "During times of crisis, makeshift states often end up collapsing, and yet the unusual ideological mix comprising the National People’s Army managed to overcome all internal divisions. The solution, proclaimed by the party as a “vast refreshment of inner quality”, was, in fact, a massive political purge of all political opponents and factions that formed in opposition to the burgeoning project. For quite some time now, the NPA ceased to function only as a paramilitary organization, with the growing party apparatus taking over many civilian governmental functions. For this reason, after a grand military parade in Lublin, Krzysztof Szwej announced the creation of the National People’s Republic of Poland, together with the releasing of a manifesto addressed to all of the country’s citizens - “The victory of the Polish working class is approaching, and just like a hundred years ago, the only legitimate government exists here, in Lublin.”"

Poland emerges from the ashes as a militaristic country, built upon the pillars of fanatical nationalism and hardline communism, causing widespread panic among neighboring states. Even separately, the two ideologies are enemies of the free world. Together, they form an axis of evil in the eyes of Western powers. \nInside the country, the truth can hardly be distinguished from propaganda, as following a bloody civil war, it is impossible to tell who died as a result of the fighting, and who was forcefully “redistributed”. In the areas where no shot has been fired for years, internment camps remain, and all political organizations except for the supreme party have been disbanded, with all opposition activity subsequently banned. \nThe National People’s Republic of Poland is moving towards another permanent revolution, and with Europe divided and at its weakest, the second half of the 21st century might just belong to National Bolshevism."
