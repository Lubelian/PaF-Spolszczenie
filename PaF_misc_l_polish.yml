 config.1.desc: "Pride and Fall currently offers two gameplay modes, depending on how you want the process of unifying Poland to unfold. You can choose one of the two options here:\n\n- §GDynamic Mode§!: In this mode, warlords won't adhere to rigid unification paths after voivodeship unification, and they will attack neighbors regardless of established unification regions. Caution! This may lead to a heart-pounding experience due to potential border gore and bugs that can develop after several years of gameplay. At the same time, this mode may not align 100% with the narrative of specific countries; some locations may not accurately reflect the actual state on the map. However, this mode is more challenging, as you never know which enemy will attack you. Or how many of them for that matter.\n\n- §GStory Mode§!: In this mode, warlords will adhere to strict unification paths and attack neighbors according to the prescribed path for their country or default path. This mode is recommended for people who want to engage in a narrative gameplay experience without excessive chaos.\n\n§RRemember, your choice lasts till the end of the game!§!"
