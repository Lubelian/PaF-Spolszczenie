config.1.desc: "Pride and Fall currently offers two gameplay modes, depending on how you want the process of unifying Poland to unfold. You can choose one of the two options here:\n\n- §GDynamic Mode§!: In this mode, warlords won't adhere to rigid unification paths after voivodeship unification, and they will attack neighbors regardless of established unification regions. Caution! This may lead to a heart-pounding experience due to potential border gore and bugs that can develop after several years of gameplay. At the same time, this mode may not align 100% with the narrative of specific countries; some locations may not accurately reflect the actual state on the map. However, this mode is more challenging, as you never know which enemy will attack you. Or how many of them for that matter.\n\n- §GStory Mode§!: In this mode, warlords will adhere to strict unification paths and attack neighbors according to the prescribed path for their country or default path. This mode is recommended for people who want to engage in a narrative gameplay experience without excessive chaos.\n\n§RRemember, your choice lasts till the end of the game!§!"

config.2.desc: "Rest in Peace - [ROOT.GetLeader]\n\nThe country leader which you begin the game with, has unfortunately departed from this world. In these virtual spaces, where different worlds intertwine, we wish to pay tribute to those who have left us since the beginning of the production of our mod. This place is not just a virtual sandbox full of references to reality but, above all, a living tribute to those ordinary people who have become immortal in our stories.\n\nAmong the shadows of the past, memories dance, and their spirits still traverse virtual avenues, leaving something elusive but undoubtedly beautiful in our hearts. They are not just heroes of strategic battles or commanders of virtual armies but, above all, real people from various walks of life who have infused the essence of reality into our mod.\n\nMay their legacy in our mod bloom like an indelible trace of their existence. This is a modest homage to these real individuals who have left us but have also left us the beauty of their lives. May our virtual narrative be not only a record of their personalities but, above all, a grateful commemoration for those who brought something extraordinary to our shared history."
