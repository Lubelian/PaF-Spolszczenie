Depending on the ammo used, they might be based on early WW2 Nebelwerfers, naval Mark 36 rocket launchers or even medieval Chinese and Korean hwachas and other fire arrow-launching weapons."

 SWE_motorized_rocket_equipment_1_short: "Technical w/ Improvised MLRS"
 SWE_motorized_rocket_equipment_1_desc: "Technicals armed with simple multiple launch rocket systems that have been either bought from abroad or made from man-portable rocket launchers or recoiless guns slapped together."
 SWE_train_equipment_1: "Found Old Trains"
 SWE_train_equipment_1_short: "Found Old Trains"
 SWE_train_equipment_1_desc: "Old, shitty trains, taken over by rust. The cargo ones are too dangerous to use due to lack of any upkeep, and the passenger ones straight up kill people with their stench of poor, sweaty passengers who had to endure standing in an overcrowded, hot tin can on wheels for 5 hours straight."
 SWE_train_equipment_2: "Reinforced Cargo Trains"
 SWE_train_equipment_2_short: "Reinforced Cargo Trains"
 SWE_train_equipment_2_desc: "Faster, more modern cargo trains with sandbags, armor plates, barbed wire and gun turrets slapped on top of them to protect whatever's inside from enemy ambushes and small-scale bombing attacks."

 SWE_train_equipment_3_short: "Motorized Draisines & War Austerity Trains"
 SWE_train_equipment_3_desc: "Rail engineer speeders repurposed as tiny transport trains and cheap, easily produced designs based off of them. They offer no protection and can be easily stopped or hijacked, but their miniscule production cost and time allows us to upkeep our supply channels through constant deployment of new trains."

 POL_motorized_equipment_1_desc: "Cars, delivery trucks, bicycles and motorbikes used by food delivery companies, buses, ruined and abandoned army trucks and any other found or stolen vehicles that can serve to transport arms, goods or troops to the frontlines. Or at least closer to the frontlines - you won't deliver supplies to an army in the middle of a forest using a bus."

 POL_anti_air_equipment_1_short: "Makeshift Anti-Air Gun"
 POL_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "Homemade guns of all sorts (rifles, machine guns, rocket launchers or autocannons, etc.) with enough range to hit things up in the sky. Given their rudimentary nature and lack of any real power, they main purpose is shooting pidgeons."

 POL_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "Makeshift Anti-Air Gun"
 POL_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "Random found or bought high-caliber, heavy machine guns and autocannons used to shoot down enemy planes marauding over allied heads. Any MG that can be mounted onto a makeshift weapon stand or a car and can damage a small, unarmored plane flying overhead - guns ranging from WW2-era Dushkas, M2 Brownings and ZPUs to whatever anti-air the Polish Army acquired from Moscow during the Cold War."      
 POL_armored_car_equipment_1: "Makeshift Armored Car"

 POL_armored_car_equipment_2_desc: "Homemade World War 2-style armored cars that offer some actual protection, but still suck in almost any other department."
