 tank_gasoline_engine: "Gasoline Car Engine"
 tank_gasoline_engine_desc: "The engine of a car-turned-impromtu tank. Less reliable, but faster."
 tank_diesel_engine: "Diesel Car Engines"
 tank_diesel_engine_desc: "A diesel engine. Less likely to catch fire after getting shot, but not as fast for the same engine size."
 tank_riveted_armor: "Rudimentary Riveted AFV Armor"
 tank_riveted_armor_desc: "Armor plates bolted to the frame and held together by rivets driven into the edges. The rivetted edges provide weakpoints in the armor and might hurt the crew if the rivets are hit."
 tank_welded_armor: "Rudimentary Welded AFV Armor"
 tank_welded_armor_desc: "Simplistic tank armor made out of metal plates welded to the chassis. Offers ease of producing and higher protection for the cost of disallowing any more complex armor shapes."
 tank_torsion_bar_suspension_desc: "A suspension system of metal bars fixed to the chassis that provides a smoother ride than other suspension types."
 tank_christie_suspension_desc: "Supension designed with driving at exceptionally high speeds in mind."
 tank_close_support_gun: "AFV-mounted Infantry Weapons"
 tank_close_support_gun_desc: "Bought, found or handcrafted infantry weapons (usually machine guns) mounted onto armored vehicles to provide support fire for nearby infantry."
 tank_radio_1: "Walkie-talkie"
 tank_radio_1_desc: "*radio static* \n-Bayo-yayo, bayo-yayo. \n*radio static* \n-Shut up over there, you fucking freak, goddamnit! No 'bayo-yayo', you fucking douche! \n*radio static* \n-Bayo-yayo, bayo-yayo. \n*radio static*"
 tank_radio_2: "Cold War-Era Communication Radio"
 tank_radio_2_desc: "Old, usually Soviet army radios that most likely partook in wars a couple of decades ago."
 tank_radio_3: "Modern Comms & Battlefield Management System"
 tank_radio_3_desc: "Systems that allow easy communication between troops and commanders and direct acquisition of information about the battlefield."
 amphibious_drive_desc: "A set of floatation devices that allow a vehicle to traverse through water, either from ship to shore or across a river."
 armor_tech_2_tt: "Enables Armor Upgrade values of 9 and above."
 armor_tech_3_tt: "Enables Armor Upgrade values of 13 and above."
 armor_tech_4_tt: "Enables Armor Upgrade values of 17 and above."
 engine_tech_2_tt: "Enables Engine Upgrade values of 9 and above."
 engine_tech_3_tt: "Enables Engine Upgrade values of 13 and above."
 engine_tech_4_tt: "Enables Engine Upgrade values of 17 and above."
 basic_medium_tank_chassis_short: "1934 Medium"
 armor_tech_1: "Improvised Composite AFV Armor"
 armor_tech_1_desc: "Lighter versions of Killdozer-style homemade composite armor, most often consisting of cement and steel. While not as thick as Heemeyer's armor, it's still enough to protect against the improvised AT weaponry of Polish ragtag armies."
 armor_tech_2: "Classic AFV Armor"
 armor_tech_2_desc: "Tank armor designs from the earlier days of the Cold War. Very simplistic in nature when compared to more modern ones, but at least they're produced in actual facilities, and not household workshops."
 armor_tech_3: "Cold War-Era AFV Armor"
 armor_tech_3_desc: "Tank armor on par with that of Cold War-era tanks. Utilizes more advanced protection techniques (such as slat armor and reactive armor) and materials than just steel and (sometimes) aluminium."
 armor_tech_4: "Modern AFV Armor"
 armor_tech_4_desc: "Armor utilized by most modern tanks."
 engine_tech_1: "Improvized AFV Engine"
 engine_tech_1_desc: "Improved homemade tank engine designs. They're still a long call from factory-made ones, but at least they're actually capable of moving heaps of steel around and enduring a few shots."
 engine_tech_2: "Classic AFV Engine"
 engine_tech_2_desc: "Simple, but factory-made tank engines. They may lack any advanced features, but they get the job done. Somewhat. Kinda... I guess..."
 engine_tech_3: "Cold War-Era AFV Engine"
 engine_tech_3_desc: "More modern tank engine models that have been taken out of captured tanks, bought abroad or built locally in a factory. Most tanks made in the '70s and '80s use one of these."
 engine_tech_4: "Modern AFV Engine"
 engine_tech_4_desc: "Modern tank engines offering the best performance and durability possible. Used by most Western XXI-century tanks."
 tank_rocket_launcher: "Primitive Rocket Launcher"
 tank_rocket_launcher_desc: "Primitive rocketry weapons, mounted onto combat vehicles. Mainly used for scaring and distracting enemies with unaimed explosions."
 tank_rocket_launcher_2: "Improvised Rocket Launcher & MLRS"
 tank_rocket_launcher_2_desc: "Improvised single-barrel and multi-barrelled launchers for unguided, high-explosive rockets. Mostly useful against soft targets, as even direct hits do little against armored targets."
