 tech_engineers: "Engineer Companies"
 tech_engineers_desc: "Using dedicated field engineers instead of ordering all troops in our ranks to dig in and prepare a proper combat position for themselves will not only increase the effectiveness of our defenses, but will also increase the morale of soldiers in our army (because noone wants to dig in mud and raise shacks for soldiers for hours only to die in a battle the next day)."

 radio: "Cold War-Era Radio & Radar Technology"
 radio_desc: "With more proper military equipment in our hands, the need for purpose-made military devices increases, as much of our new equipment requires their functions to work, forcing us to acquire cheap, old radios, radars and other measurement and detection systems from abroad. New radios will make communication between various sectors of the army easier, and new detection devices will allow us to set up some proper (if VERY old by today's standards) defensive systems and intel acquisition systems on our turf, to further secure our hold over it."

 basic_machine_tools: "Basic Tools & Dedicated Workshops"
 basic_machine_tools_desc: "The Polish industry is dead, meaning that we cannot produce any advanced tools, machines or weapons. In fact, no one else can. \n\n...which is why it's perfectly A-OK for us to use haphazardly selfmade weaponry! \n\nWe should establish workshops dedicated to production of melee weapons and simplistic firearms that later on will serve as the basis of a proper guns industry once our statelet develops enough."
 improved_machine_tools: "Machine Tools & Basic Factories"
 improved_machine_tools_desc: "With more lands under our control and more taxpayers to live off, time has come for us to increase our military output in order to keep up the tempo of our expansion. \n\nMachine tools will allow us to restart the production of less complicated pieces of equipment and replacement parts for them. With them, we can slowly start building actual (if still very rudimentary) factories. \n\n"

 flexible_line: "Flexible Factories"
 flexible_line_desc: "Specialized factories might be more effiecient, but they won't be able to easily shift their production to a different type of equipment when the need for it comes, meaning that we might find ourselves in a situation where our stockpiles are drowning in - for example - guns, but our soldiers have nothing to shoot out of those guns. \n\n"

 improved_equipment_conversion: "Machine Tools & Standardized Weapon Conversions"
 improved_equipment_conversion_desc: "The civil war is far from over, and as such we have to constantly prepare for new things to come. War brings innovation, and us, our soldiers and our enemies constantly come up with new, more refined ways to kill each other. These inventions are still fairly rudimentary and can be easily implemented in weapons we already use, however. As such, we should form a standardized system for weapon modification and retrofits to make sure our army keeps up with the times and their grubby little hands get hold of new equipment faster. \n"
 advanced_equipment_conversion: "Dedicated Equipment Conversion Facilities"
 advanced_equipment_conversion_desc: "Setting up specialized production facilities for retrofitting our less effective weapons will allow us to quickly fix any of their flaws and keep our equipment efficient at all times."

 concentrated_industry: "Concentrated Industry"
 concentrated_industry_desc: "Focusing our manufacturing facilities to a few key sites will make sharing resources and tools easier, driving down the production costs.\n\n"
 concentrated_industry2_desc: "Further concentration of our manufactures will improve their efficiency and lower the need for long supply chains that can be easily disrupted by enemies."
 concentrated_industry3_desc: "As we start building a proper industry, the condensation of our production sectors will make it easier to bring them to a higher standard."

 dispersed_industry_desc: "By spreading out our workshops, we can ensure that every unit of our army has a nearby place to acquire and refurbish their equipment.\n\n"
 dispersed_industry2_desc: "Spreading our production facilities out means that if one of them falls into enemy hands, the enemy won't gain that much and we won't simultaneously lose an entire production sector."
 dispersed_industry3_desc: "As our workshops evolve into proper factories, we start establishing production chains between our industrial facilities. The dispersed model of our industry means that enemies won't be able to target specific industrial sectors and cockblock the production of specific goods and armaments."
 dispersed_industry4_desc: "With our factories being dispersed all over the place, we can easily increase their secrecy and camouflage them."
 dispersed_industry5_desc: "By having not only our industry, but the infrastructure tying it together operate in secrecy, we can make it even more difficult to destroy."

 better_concrete1: "Safer Production Camp Designs"
 better_concrete1_desc: "Just because almost all of our weapon production facilities consist of massive tent camps, we shouldn't have to rebuild sizeable chunks of our military industry from the ground up every time an enemy party or a bombing squadron encounters one of them during a raid. With a couple extra sandbags, some tree branches and a few tarpaulins covered in camo, we can sharply reduce the visibility of our production centers and simultaneously increase their resistance against damage."
 better_concrete2: "Damageproofed Factory Designs"
 better_concrete2_desc: "As we slowly transition from tent manufactories to proper factories, we need to make sure our new production lines will stand the bombs, missiles and shells fired at them. As such, we should see to it that they're built according to military construction designs and guidelines."
 better_concrete3: "Cold War-Era Factory Designs"
 better_concrete3_desc: "Although communism-era architecture was gray, boring, ugly and depressing mess, its main purpose was to take on hundreds of shots and explosions without coming crashing down - and at that it is still extremely useful, as was shown during the Russo-Ukrainian war. Additionally, it was designed to be extremely cheap to construct, so stop waiting for another enemy bomb attack and get to work at the concrete mixer, comrade! - the metalworkers have already finished the next batch of reinforcement bars and are waiting for you to stop slacking. \nAnd remember: trust in żelbet!"

 construction1: "Partial Post-Fall Reconstruction"
 construction1_desc: "Due to the immense destruction of infrastructure across the country, tons of people have to live in shacks and buildings with so many holes in them that they put Swiss cheese to shame, and there's noone to repair all this damage since most construction companies are either suffering from massive manpower and resource shortages or not functioning altogether. Thankfully, concrete isn't that hard to make, and many people are left without real jobs or homes, thus organizing them and sending them off to rebuild their homes is gonna be easy."
 construction2: "Patodeweloperka"
 construction2_desc: "Our people are still in dire need of more homes and more infrastructure of both the civilian and the military kind. Thankfully, we have the resources to conduct a mass building project that will provide them with state-of-the-art Donbabwean architecture such as claustrophobic, unventilated blockhouses to live in and bureaus set up in shipping containers."
 construction3: "Small-Scale Construction"
 construction3_desc: "If our buildings are to be both resistant and able to provide at least the minimal comfort of living, we sadly have to resort to good ol' Soviet methods of small-scale housing construction - concrete cubes housing one or two families. Yes, they're eyesores, but they're better than living in shacks and rubble."
 construction4: "Large-Scale Reconstruction"
 construction4_desc: "Abandoned sports centres, factories and shopping malls might make for good urban exploration spots, but their size and upkeep costs significantly outweight the benefits of simply leaving them be and letting them slowly crumble away. While we couldn't do anything about them earlier, now our state can afford to rebuild abandoned complexes of this kind and give them a new function."
 construction5: "Large-Scale Construction"
 construction5_desc: "Villages and provincial towns that suffered the most from wars between warlords rejoice as new apartment blocks, schools, chapels, factories and other large building complexes start dotting their landscapes. Cities finally start to resemble their past selves from before the Fall, and small settlements grow in strenght and people, with provisory housings and destroyed tanks no longer making up the bulk of their infrastructure."

 better_prisons: "Improved Policing & Ad-Hoc Law Enforcement"
 better_prisons_desc: "Ad-hoc law enforcement systems are very handy and easily understandable, but they're also very inefficient - especially when your policing forces consist of sub-80 IQ bald guys armed with bats and clubs who've been tasked with walking all day in circle from one remote place to another. \nIf we are to efficiently (or at least *slightly more* efficiently) root out people endangering our rule, we need to thoroughly restructure our law enforcement services' staff and modes of operation so that our paramilitaries have an easier time fishing out resistance members."
 better_hospitals: "Partial Healthcare System Reestablishment"
 better_hospitals_desc: "''Cough-cough.'' - says one village grandpa to another. ''Urkh, gurhhk.'' - says the other one. \nThese men caught a flu - an ailment overlooked by most around the world... and yet, in post-Fall Poland it's practically a death sentence. Our healthcare system can't treat even the most basic illnesses due to currently consisting of a couple clinics treating their patients with nothing but Apap and Amol. As we grow our influence and fund pools, we should begin reestablishing the less advanced healthcare sectors to provide at least the bare minimum of medical care to our citizens."
 better_citystuff: "Commercial & Corporate Infrastructure Improvement"
 better_citystuff_desc: "Our commercial infrastructure projects have managed to bring back some normalcy in our people's lives, but in order to fully bring them back to the XXIst century, we'll have to provide more than 80's sheet metal warehouses and kiosks. \n\nOur country's existing and future commercial infrastructure needs to be reelectrified and modernized: streets with shops need to be lit up again, shopping malls need to be repopulated by stores and corporate high-rises need to be resettled by poor office workers, toiling their lives away for their lovely corporate overlords."
 less_limits: "Full Public Services Revival"
 less_limits_desc: "We have made great efforts to bring back what was before the Fall: health services, public infrastructure, businesses and such, but the state of public services in our country is still far from how they were back in the day. \n\nTo fully amend for what our people had to go through in the past years, we should conduct a program of restoring the country's health, education and transport sectors, as well as any other civilian infrastructure types that have suffered during the Polish Civil War."

 excavation1: "Dedicated Scavenging Teams"
 excavation1_desc: "We lack the equipment and manpower to reopen old mines and factories, but is it really a problem? There's plenty of spare scrap anyway, so in theory we could simply institutionalize pillaging as an integral part of our economy and create dedicated scavenging teams to gather whatever the old world has left behind until we'll finally have the means to restart industrial production in Poland."
 excavation2: "Pre-Fall Shops & Industrial Facilities Survey"
 excavation2_desc: "Though more and more reusable scrap keep falling into our hands as our expansion progresses, we cannot keep satiating our industry with just the remains of the old world. As such, we should conduct a survey of shops and industrial plants that used to function here, but burned down, shut down or came crashing down during the Fall - not only will this let us to search more deeply and greedily amongst the rubble, but will also map down abandoned and destroyed kiosks, shops and other small-scale enterprises that still can be revived after throughout cleanups and repairs."
 excavation3: "Post-Fall Cleanup & Small-Scale Enterprises Revival"
 excavation3_desc: "Now that people start to live their normal lives again, time has come to restore the small shops and kiosks that didn't survive the Fall, but could still be brung up to function like in the old times. Let's fix the damaged walls and windows, clean up the mess left behind by escaping shopkeepers, salvage whatever might still be useful to us and then - finally - let people move back to these places, restarting their now-extinguished hearts. \n\nAfter we seize the places that might be repurposed by the army first, of course."

###excavation2: "Bootleg & Artisanal Mining"
###excavation2_desc: "Pickaxes, mining camps for POWs and/or undesirables, shovels and tiny, makeshift tunnels - those things make up the Polish mining industry in 2027. Those things also make up a large part of our peacetime casualties. That's why we should implement some safety standards for artisanal mining so that more people will make it out alive - because *trust me*, it's more profitable to increase the amount of resources excavated now than to make long-term investments into buried remains of miners slowly turning into oil."
###excavation3: "Large-Scale Mining Industry Revival"
###excavation3_desc: "Old mines and oil pumps that weren't affected by time that much and still can be made operable again should be reopened by us so that we may gain a bit of resources to sell to foreign companies. \n\n...yes, that WILL effectively turn us into a banana republic, but it's worth to sacrifice our dignity for a couple dolla."
###excavation4: "Large-Scale Process Industry Revival"
###excavation4_desc: "With our resource gathering industries up and running again, we can begin reviving various process industries to gain further funds, goods and materials to use. Too bad we cannot regain our dignity, and we're still a bunch of bitches belonging to foreign petrol and metal making concerns."
###excavation5: "Large-Scale Discrete Industry Revival"
###excavation5_desc: "With more and more resources being available again, we can bring car, furniture, toy, clothes, phones and industrial machinery manufacturing back to life. We're still not a *proper* state, so we can resort to more partisan sources of employment (like convicts and people who are *a bit too young* for manual labor), and a promising, developing industry with plenty of goods to sell to rich people and companies will bring in plenty of foreign investors! \nAhhh... I can already smell the SWEET, SWEET STENCH of FAT STACKS OF CASH that our children and underpaid workers will earn for us!"

 synth_oil_experiments: "Rudimentary Plastics & Rubber Recycling Plants"
 synth_oil_experiments_desc: "Mechanical recycling of plastics is actually quite easy and doesn't require any sophisticated equipment - you just wash the plastic, grind it and then melt it into a new form! Rubber recycling - sadly - involves much fewer fun carcinogenic fumes -- it mostly boils down to refurbishment of already existing products and grinding tyres down into small fragments that can be used in a few other industries."
 rubber_processing: "Civilian Plastic Item Refurbishment & Alternatives"
 rubber_processing_desc: "So far, there's no other way to improve the output of our slum-like plastic melter kiddie pool camps than to just cut down on the use of plastics. As such, the best thing we can do is a) implementing bans on plastics use by civilians and providing them with alternatives that won't affect their daily lives too much, and b) expanding our rubber item refurbishment plants to also include the populace's need for tyres and other rubber things."
 improved_rubber_processing: "Advanced Mechanical Plastics Recycling"
 improved_rubber_processing_desc: "Though much cheaper in upkeep, our India-style plastic melting workshops give us a bad name among the international community. Thankfully, we're finally able to start building proper mechanical plastics recycling plants with looks more befitting of Polish slums in Łódź, rather than Indian slums in Mumbai. These also shouldn't leave (as many) people living in the vicinity enriched in cancer cells and lung diseases."
 advanced_rubber_processing: "Advanced Rubber Recycling & Synthetic Materials Factories"
 advanced_rubber_processing_desc: "Gone are the days of having to wash ourselves in the same plastic bowls we vomited in day earlier - we can finally afford to start producing our own synthetic materials! It's time to restart old factories and build new (even if still quite basic) ones that utilize more refined, effective tools and production ways than the makeshift tent camps we used to lock people in during the earlier days of the Fall."
 modern_rubber_processing: "Mechanical & Chemical Plastic Recycling Industry"
 modern_rubber_processing_desc: "The days of ordering people to mix melted plastic in bumshacks are over, as we can finally afford to create proper mechanical plastic recycling plants. We don't *have* to do so, however, as there is a more modern and ecologically friendly way of recycling plastic appearing on the horizon - it consists of breaking plastics down into monomers to form new polymers that can then be formed into completely new items. This technique is a fairly new thing even in the rest of Europe, so switching to this method of recycling could additionally earn us some handouts from American and European green activists. And as we all know: money good."

 refinery_eq1: "Small-Scale Agrorefineries"
 refinery_eq1_desc: "Plenty of tiny, local agrorefineries dot the Polish countryside. In fact, village bio-diesel production buildings are one of the few industrial facilities that managed to not only survive the Fall, but also to capitalize on it, being the only sure source of fuel available to the commoners who upkeep the production with their own farm byproducts. We should capitalize on this on a state level to ease-up our fuel availability problems. \n\nAt least until we start wrecking the fields with mass artillery barrages."
 refinery_eq2: "Large-Scale Agrorefining Industry"
 refinery_eq2_desc: "Our territory grows, and so does our hunger for fuel. Thankfully, so does the endless sea of farmlands ready to grow some future biofuel. \nBy investing in a large-scale agrorefining industry, we can partially solve our state's fuel shortage problems and smoothen out our oil industry's transition from utter disarray to at least a half-decent state."
 refinery_eq3: "Oil Refining Industry Revival"
 refinery_eq3_desc: "As our state grew larger, it started receiving back resources from abroad, especially oil, which Poland never produced on a large scale domestically. Thankfully, Obajtek managed to at least preserve whatever pieces of Orlen's and its subsidiaries' infrastructure remained across the country, all thanks to his companies' political power - as such, we can bring back the few oil-related industries that were blooming, since if we want to return Poland to how she was before the Fall, we'll have to rebuild those sectors of our industry."

 fuel_silos_desc: "Even if - by some divine intervention - we manage to stumble upon some fuel supplies during our struggle for control over Poland's rotting corpse, we still have to somehow transport that fuel to an uncontested place for storage. Now here's a question: how do we move an entire gas station's worth of fuel from a warzone to a city that's 50km away using canisters? \nThe answer: we don't. Instead, we invest into (or rather steal) a fuel truck fleet. \nNow here's another question: how do we upkeep an entire convoy of fuel trucks with our current funds?"
 fuel_refining: "Fuel Rationing & Substitute Fuels"
 fuel_refining_desc: "Though being able to buy only a canister of fuel per week might be a very harsh limit, you have to remember that the fuel supplies used by civilians are also used by our military, so please shut the fuck up and stop saying ''literally 1984'' when we tell you to tank your Audi A4 B5 1.9GDI with cooking oil."
 fuel_refining2: "Oil Extraction Industry Revival"
 fuel_refining2_desc: "The Polish oil extraction industry was... a rather underdeveloped one, at least compared to some of our neighbours, but we should still attempt to revive it to slowly start remedying our country's perpetual fuel shortage. Thankfully, with more funds, we can slowly start pulling people who had the know-how on how to run an oil pump back to the country. \n\nOr we could just invite some giant oil company to start milking the few crude oil deposits in our country for a couple dolla."
 fuel_refining3: "International Oil/Gas Transit"
 fuel_refining3_desc: "With the international community slowly coming to the terms with the thought of recognizing us as the legitimate government of Poland, we can slowly start convincing our neighbours and ex-trade partners to restart the oil and gas trade that our country used to partake in -- we'll just have to hammer out all the damage left on the pipelines."
