TNO.1.t: "A Beautiful Story..."
TNO.1.desc: "The door swung open with a bang. KMT squaked. His skirt moved slightly due to the gust of wind. Schab, with determination painted on his face, ran into the room and picked him up into his arms. The copy of W. Reymont's 'The Peasants' slipped from the Bumfuckian femboy's hand.\n\nWhat's happening? What are you doing? - he asked Schab in a trembling voice.\n\nSchab didn't reply. Instead, he moved his lips closer to KMT's lips. At first, the femboy tried to resist, but he gave up after a couple of seconds. Relaxed, he embraced Schab's head with his hand, prolonging the kiss. A good minute has passed before they’ve finished.\n\nBut why? - KMT asked in a whisper - Why right now? \nI have nothing to lose - Schab responded, looking back where he came from.\n\nA gigantic, rotting figure in a stahlhelm was staring at them with its inhuman face.\n\nWHERE THE FUCK IS THE FINISHED MAP OF PODLACHIA? - the figure roared with such power and fury, that the ground quaked violently.\n\nKMT and Schab looked at each other. They knew what was about to happen to them. So, they kissed again.\n\nAnd they kept on kissing each other until the end.\n\nFin."

POLITICS_SPEEREK_DESC: "...Albert Speer? ...W-what do you mean, ''Albert Speer''? What, the Nazi minister and architect? What about him?\n\n...He's here? You're saying he's here? Talking with us? \n\n*sigh* \n\nRequest to administer another dose... yes, and two more pills. Thank you.\n\n\n\nAlright, listen buddy, I'll be blunt: *THERE IS NO ALBERT SPEER*. He's long gone. Has been for the past 50 years. \nThere is no TNO either. It's just a figment of your imagination. An outlandish alternate universe you've made up inside your head. There's no ''Atlantropas'', ''funny desk events'', ''Ultravisionary space programmes'' and whatever other ''Speer- and Yagoda-themed blueberry homogenized cheese'' you've been rambling about to yourself when staring blankly into nearby walls. They're not here. They're not anywhere. They just don't exist. They never did in the first place. \n\nC'mon, it's time for you to bring your head out of clouds and get a grip on reality. Please swallow your pills and be a good boy. \nOkay?"
