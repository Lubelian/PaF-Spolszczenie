unification.116.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Bielany unify the Capital District!"
unification.116.desc:0 "Today Dawid Podsiadło, singer and now the charismatic leader of Bielany Union of Feminists, declared in his announcement the successful seizure of all the lands of the former capital city. \n\nThe model country which Podsiadło aspires to create is built on a decentralized economy (following the so-called Small-Town System) and the negation of patriarchy. Podsiadło's clique preaches and enforces progressive and feminist values - enforces being the right choice for words, as the state's law enforcement duties are held by The Pink Shirts, a brutal, ideological militia. Not hesitant to brutally squash any opposition, Podsiadło does not see a problem with installing a de-facto totalitarian regime while speaking about tolerance, European values and equality, proclaiming that such values ''befit a strongman, not a passive protester''."
unification.116.a:0 "A Smalltownsman in a Big City."
