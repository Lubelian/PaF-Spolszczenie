 air_parity_desc: "Security against enemy air strikes is paramount and should remain a priority arming and training interceptors and anti-air corps. Strengthening our air zone and maximizing enemy shootings down may allow us to fight evenly in the air over time."
 fighter_primacy: "Fighter Primacy"
 fighter_primacy_desc: "Fighters as the backbone of our air army are used for all major operations in the sky. When a great number of them will fly over the sky, nothing from the enemy will stand there."
 fighter_doctrine_2: "Agility Focus"
 fighter_doctrine_2_desc: "Exercises of dexterity and pilots' overload will contribute to increasing the agility of our squadrons. Once the pilots know the maximum of their machines and bodies they will feel more confident in battles."

 fighter_doctrine_3_desc: "Our dedicated pilots take §Rpride§! in their important but dangerous role in defending our skies along with rebuilding the nation. That glory should be shaped carefully, so that it will benefit us §Rand§! does not lead to their §Rfall§!."
 fighter_doctrine_4: "Healthy Competition"
 fighter_doctrine_4_desc: "Rivalisation in the same lane is usually an undesirable phenomenon. However, turning it into meaningful competition can contribute to increasing the motivation of pilots to achieve better results."
 fighter_doctrine_5: "Increased Vigilance"
 fighter_doctrine_5_desc: "In addition to the main objectives of fighters, it is important to allocate special forces to escort bombers vulnerable to surprise attacks. Additionally training in radar reading, communication and perceptiveness will be carried out."
 fighter_doctrine_6: "Help From Bigger Boys"
 fighter_doctrine_6_desc: "While our swift and deadly fighters scour the skies and fight against every flying danger, there are also ground-based shootout attempts. Our heavy bombers will especially destroy anti-aircraft artillery positions to best protect the airwings."
 the_bomber_will_get_through: "Bomber Primacy"
 the_bomber_will_get_through_desc: "Use of bombers as the backbone of our airforce may be risky, but the appropriate adaptation of the planes with a suitable escort can quickly cause heavy losses on enemy soil, which will contribute significantly to the destruction of their aviation."
 bomber_doctrine_2: "Precise Bombing"
 bomber_doctrine_2_desc: "Drilling bombs on various targets, including moving ones, is crucial in improving the skills of our pilots in destroying the enemy on the ground and also will save on equipment."
 bomber_doctrine_3: "Pilots' Awarness"
 bomber_doctrine_3_desc: "Bombers need to be more vigilant in missions as they are unequal in the fight against enemy fighters. Therefore, their radars and their service should be of the highest possible level, also on the ground."
 bomber_doctrine_4: "Night Raids"
 bomber_doctrine_4_desc: "When the enemy is asleep and cannot see the sky, large-scale bombing raids can be made. The target will be mainly permanent objects such as infrastructure, airports, military bases, etc."
 bomber_doctrine_5: "Large-caliber Operations"
 bomber_doctrine_5_desc: "Highest payload strategic bombers are the future of our air force. Our doctrine should focus on the greater role of these powerful machines that can sweep entire cities from the surface."
 bomber_doctrine_6: "Bomber Air Combat"
 bomber_doctrine_6_desc: "Arming our bombers in big caliber guns for effective destroying of enemy fighters and training shooters will give our squadrons new opportunities. Running away won't be only option anymore."

 fixed_wing_cas_3: "Helping Our Warships"
 fixed_wing_cas_3_desc: "Our fleet may be vulnerable to attacks by enemy planes and ships. To protect them from danger, our maritime patrols should be wider and more frequent, and our methods of fighting enemy sea units better."
 fixed_wing_cas_4: "Prereaction"
 fixed_wing_cas_4_desc: "A quick response is indicative, but acting in front of the enemy is even better. Increased vigilance and rapid surprise attacks should sufficiently reduce enemy airwings."
 fixed_wing_cas_5: "Defense of CAS Planes"
 fixed_wing_cas_5_desc: "Army support planes are worse against enemy fighters. Therefore, we should equip them with effective defense, and train pilots and shooters so that they are not defenseless in such situations."
 fixed_wing_cas_6: "Long Raids"
 fixed_wing_cas_6_desc: "Due to the careful consumption of fuel, we can fly further. By using better technique and piloting methods, we can increase the rank of our warplanes."

 lf_doctrine_2: "Volunteer Lectures"
 lf_doctrine_2_desc: "The most important thing is that our people are eager to defend national sky. Those with experience give open lessons and the defense staff eagerly learns the techniques of fighting the flying enemy."
 lf_doctrine_3: "Reliable Parts"
 lf_doctrine_3_desc: "By focusing on protecting our skies, we can resort to building airplanes from cheaper and more light materials. They will be less durable, but will prove themselves in short defensive missions."
 lf_doctrine_4: "Protectors Of The Homeland"
 lf_doctrine_4_desc: "Sacrifice is important to our pilots. Sweat, tears and blood are the prices they are able to pay for safety of others, when your loved ones are exposed to bombardments every hour of the day."
 lf_doctrine_5: "Windfliers"
 lf_doctrine_5_desc: "Our light planes are good at gliding when you don't need an engine to run, in this way we save on fuel, extending the range and it's also a way of disguising yourself from the enemy."
 lf_doctrine_6: "Strike Like Lighting"
 lf_doctrine_6_desc: "An attack on our territory may cost the enemy a fair amount of losses. We can strike like lightning from our strewn and hidden runways anytime. We are ready and prepared."
 promotion_of_aa: "Promotion of AA"
 promotion_of_aa_desc: "We do not have the ability to fight a stronger enemy in the air, but it does not mean that we are defenseless. Our anti-air systems will be operational and the crew will fully repel enemy air strikes."
 aa_doctrine_2: "The Observers"
 aa_doctrine_2_desc: "We watch the sky all the time. Radars and radios work non-stop, and at night searchlights look for intruders in our sky. The enemy can never feel confident in our territory."
 aa_doctrine_3: "Comunication Of Defence Positions"
 aa_doctrine_3_desc: "The dug and mobile AAA positions scattered across our land are in constant communication with each other. An unidentified movement will be noticed and distributed among our defence mesh."
 aa_doctrine_4: "Best Up The Skies"
 aa_doctrine_4_desc: "Those who prove to be the best in all aspects will be able to fight in our small air fleet. It is not much, but their influence may determine the fate of the air defense of our lands."
 aa_doctrine_5: "City Air Defences"
 aa_doctrine_5_desc: "In addition to anti-aircraft positions and AA armored trucks, our cities will also be ready. Inhabitants undergo air raid training, and special shelters are created in each urban and industrial center."
 aa_doctrine_6: "Intercepting Enemy"
 aa_doctrine_6_desc: "We are more and more confident looking at the sky. The enemy already knows that we are not an easy target. Learned fighting techniques are consolidated and our methods are improved."
 massing_the_boats: "Massing The Boats"
 massing_the_boats_desc: "Organizing civic boats does not prove to be an easy and quick task. However, when we finally collect and set them in formation, they can count as a fighting force on water reservoirs."
 rods_to_rifles: "Rods To Rifles"
 rods_to_rifles_desc: "The basic armament of our boats is not difficult, there is only needed couple of mariners and gun for them and it will give us water units with the ability to board enemy boats and to cover land formations."
 creating_the_navy: "Creating The Navy"
 creating_the_navy_desc: "With the development of warfare, our amateur navy must be turned into a professional fleet. Boats and larger units must be standardized and crews trained in one common operating system."
 brown_water_navy: "Brown Water Navy"
 brown_water_navy_desc: "In shallow river water zones, light and fast units cooperating with branches on the shores are the most effective. We can control our tides with less needed resources with greater possibility of improvisation."
 green_water_navy: "Green Water Navy"
 green_water_navy_desc: "A focus on a fleet that can operate on rivers as well as in the open sea. Having larger units, this doctrine will offer a broad spectrum of various activities that should be the most promising."
 escort_buffs: "Escort Focus"
 escort_buffs_desc: "Our fleet is too vulnerable and an attack on the enemy could mean the end of our presence in the waters. Everything we have should focus on protecting our transport, trade and other civilian units."
 escort_buffs_2: "Detection And Escape"
 escort_buffs_2_desc: "Our captains shouldn't be playing tough, especially when they're escorting defenseless units. Careful observation and retreat when the enemy is certainly pushing forward will save a lot of valuable people and equipment."
 escort_buffs_3: "Depth Survey"
 escort_buffs_3_desc: "Checking the underwater for mines is essential prior to transport operations. Often these small, makeshift loads are difficult to detect, but with time and with the right methods, it is possible."
 raiding_buffs: "Raiding Tactics"
 raiding_buffs_desc: "With small and fast units, we can bite the enemy vulnerable units devoid of firepower and run away when he tries to return the blow. This will quickly cause the enemy's logistical ruin."
 raiding_buffs_2: "Modern Wolf Packs"
 raiding_buffs_2_desc: "The old technique of small offensive groups can be perfected in the fashion of Post-Fall Poland. Little needs to be changed and the effectiveness of the attacks will surely increase."
 raiding_buffs_3: "Known Enemy Routes"
 raiding_buffs_3_desc: "Observation is the most arduous but the most important element of planning an attack. When we know the paths of enemy units and the time of patrols, we will be able to strike without our losses."
 tbs_as_escorts: "Warships As Escorts"
 tbs_as_escorts_desc: "Focusing the core of our fleet on defending weak boats is essential. Engaging in unnecessary combat will not bring much at this point and the risk of lossing some unit is too great."
 tbs_as_escorts_2: "Hard Side To Enemy"
 tbs_as_escorts_2_desc: "It's not about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!"
 tbs_as_escorts_3: "Signal From Every Way"
 tbs_as_escorts_3_desc: "Knowing, seeing or hearing which side to expect the attack from, gives the defenders a great advantage at the start. Let the radio operators remain vigilant at all times is a great task."
 river_battleships: "River Battleships"
 river_battleships_desc: "We have the ability to rule in the waters of former Poland. Our ships are powerful, but let us not leave indifferent to the arming enemy. Let's destroy it while we have the upper hand."
 river_battleships_2: "Staying Cool When It's Hot"
 river_battleships_2_desc: "It can get hot with any battle. When the sides crumble under a hail of missiles and the deck is smeared with the blood of the sailors, control can be lost. That's when it is necessary to keep the grip and restore order on the board."
 river_battleships_3: "Quick-change Combat Formation"
 river_battleships_3_desc: "Fluency in the formation of our ships and, above all, in the minds of admiralty is the key to win in any unusual battle. Thanks to the unlimited way out of oppression, the enemy can easily get lost in action."

 heavy_monitor_armor_3_desc: "Simple, but thick armor used by heavy ships, mitigating most of damage dealt by impromptu weaponry used by warlord navies."
 heavy_monitor_armor_4: "Modern Heavy Naval Armor"
 heavy_monitor_armor_4_desc: "Though most modern navies only use light armor due to heavier armor not being that effective against most modern naval and rocket weaponry, in a combat between not as strongly armed warlord fleets heavy protection can be extremely useful."

 torpedos_4_desc: "Proper torpedo launchers and modern torpedoes, used by navies worldwide."
 post_collapse_assesment: "Post-Fall Assessment"
 post_collapse_assesment_desc: "The Polish state has succumbed into chaos and disintegrated. Laws are enforced ad-hoc, most industries have died or stopped working and most people have to ration food, water and other resources due to the downfall of most supply chains and shops (besides Żabka. Żabka could survive a fucking nuclear disaster and still somehow capitalize on it), resulting in what is basically a light post-apo scenario. \n\nWe have to assess the damage done during the Fall to start rebuilding a new state out of the ruins of old Poland."
 improvised_computing: "Civilian-Grade Government Computing"
 improvised_computing_desc: "We currently have to rely on mobile phones, handwritten documents and a few spare printers and laptops that belonged to people forming our new government, most of them still running Windows Vista. By gathering and restoring whatever civilian computers we can find, we can at least *partially* restore normalcy in how the government operates. At least in moments when the neighbouring warlords aren't burdening the power grid."
 early_civilian_computing: "Reestablishment Of Businesses & Civilian Computing"
 early_civilian_computing_desc: "As the chaos in the country died down, the emerging political movements became entrenched and people got used to living in a war-torn country, the population slowly started rebuilding itself, reestablishing their businesses and/or workplaces and using computers on a daily basis again, which sets us on a course to veeeeeeeeeeery slowly revert the brain drain that our country suffered from during the Fall."
 civilian_computing: "Reestablished Education System & Basic Military Development Sectors"
 civilian_computing_desc: "As our statelet grows in power and possesses more resources, we can finally start rebuilding the education sector of the government, reestablishing smaller, rural education facilities, providing them with resources and providing people with easier access to them. \nWe can also establish a proper - if very basic - military development sector in the army and the government, so that our army no longer has to test and adapt new equipment by testing it in a far-away field, hoping that it doesn't explode and instantly kill them during usage."
 imported_mainframes: "Reestablished Intelligentsia"
 imported_mainframes_desc: "As the country rebuilds itself, and more and more elements of pre-Fall life return back, our political and academic spheres start to claw back to life, with academies and universities slowly filling back in and various small political notions evolving amongst people. By luring parts of intelligentsia back to our country, we can start to properly revert the brain drain in our lands."
 military_grade_computing: "Military-Grade Government Computing & Advanced Military Development Sectors"
 military_grade_computing_desc: "As we've evolved into a proper state, our need for computing power, room for data storage and a proper military development sector in the government has increased tenfold. By establishing an advanced governmental military R&D body and restoring the military-grade governmental computers that used to serve the old Polish gov, we can finally enter the Proper Government Club and start operating as a proper, established power in Central Europe."
 improvised_ballistic_computer: "Civilian-Grade Computers w/ Military Integration"
 improvised_ballistic_computer_desc: "We have barely any (if any at all) access to computers that whould allow us to use modern military vehicles and equipment - ergo, we have to resort to using normal, civilian computers that have been integrated with military tech, allowing us to use modern weapons or to use them as improvised onboard computers."

 improvised_radio: "Civilian Radio & Radar Technology"
 improvised_radio_desc: "As Poland vanished, so did most of its military infrastructure and equipment - most army facilities have been robbed clean or thrashed completely, leaving us only with civilian radios (usually household ones or old, portable ones used by fishing grandpas), walkie-takies used by kids and few civilian radars that usually serve single, very specific purposes. Thankfully, most cliques in Poland are as ragtag as us, so currently we're fine with civilian radios and radars that have been tinkered with to adapt them for army purposes."
 battlefield_management_systems: "Modern Battlefield Management Systems"
 battlefield_management_systems_desc: "A battlefield management system - BMS for short - is a system meant to integrate information acquisition and processing to enhance command and control of a military unit.

 vpn_and_tor: "VPNs & Onion Routing"
 vpn_and_tor_desc: "To further secure our data, we can employ cheaply available civilian-grade encryption techniques, such as using VPNs and onion routing. A proper government would still have an easy time finding our Internet activity, but for Polish standards such measures will be more than enough. \n\nNow comes the hard part, however: how do we teach 60 years old clerks how to use Tor?"
 not_pegasus: "Exclusive Communication Networks"
 not_pegasus_desc: "With much more funds and power in our hands, we are finally able to create our own network for exchanging information between various government agencies - one inaccessible to anyone outside the government.

 adhoc_trollbrigades: "Ad Hoc Troll Brigades"
 adhoc_trollbrigades_desc: "Cold War has ruined the public image of wars. World order set in 2001 started to break down and now people start to thirst for blood of others once more, yet war is still percieved as an ugly, and - most importantly - a very unnecessary thing. Because of that, every modern country that gets into conflicts with others employs internet trolls to sway people to their side and cover any mishaps that happened while they were enforcing their will upon others. We should do the same - let's recruit some people to start spreading propaganda in social media to turn people against our enemies and to make ourselves look better in their eyes."
 internet_troll_agencies: "Professional Troll Brigades"
 internet_troll_agencies_desc: "Amateurish trolls can be useful, but over time people start to realise they're just shouting things on the Internet. Professional troll agencies, however, are able to sow so much disinformation and chaos in the Web to affect politics in other countries and create loyalists that support foreign regimes with their lives despite never having any contact with them or their countries. The past Russian government has mastered this technique, employing internet troll farms to dictate how anti-American politics are conducted on the Internet, and we should establish similar troll cells in our government to sow foreign support for our cause."
 ai_trollbots: "AI Trollbots & Troll Brigades"
 ai_trollbots_desc: "The early '20s were a period of major development of machine learning bots. Bots of all kinds - image-creating bots, chat bots, and of course - trollbots. Trollbots that were fed with so many data samples, that they were almost able to pass the Turing test, as shown by a bot fed with samples from /pol/ that managed to fool many 4chan users into thinking that it's a real person. Over years, more and more such bots were employed by troll farms to spread agendas over the Internet, therefore, to increase the effeciency of our troll agencies, we should start investing into bots (let's start with simple ones) helping with sowing chaos in Internet discourses."

 advanced_ai_trollbots_desc: "An advanced, machine-learning algorythm - a perfect propaganda machine, that lures edgy American teenargers and 'woke' horoscope-reading spiritualists into sacrificing their hearts and minds for an agenda that was made up by a bunch of old men fighting a war in Central Europe. If we were to find the right person that could create a bot like this for our purposes, our government's trolls could multiply the effectiveness and the reach of our troll agencies by tenfolds, potentially creating a permament mark on Internet politics and worldviews."
