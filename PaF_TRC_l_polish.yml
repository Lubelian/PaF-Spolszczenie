unification.30.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Torcida Zabrze unifies Upper Silesia!"
unification.30.desc:0 "Against all odds, ultras of Górnik Zabrze, spearheaded by the famous Torcida, have managed to unify the entirety of the Silesian Metropolis – an event stoically commented on by the team’s coach Adam Nawałka with just a single phrase "We are fighting very well, both defensively and offensively". The fans, however, remain confused, unsure whether this development is any consolation for the lack of on-pitch success. Bells rang throughout Zabrze, as the coach was officially granted the ceremonial hen at the newly rebuilt Górnik stadium. For his efforts, Nawałka has become an icon in Silesia, and unlike his Truskolasy counterpart, he never had to rely on a forced cult of personality to achieve so. But how can one properly organize a country run by a group of dimwitted hooligans and headed by a run-of-the-mill football coach who can already barely motivate eleven players, much less the population of an entire region?"
