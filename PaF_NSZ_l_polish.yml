unification.123.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The Holy Cross Society unifies the Voivodeship!"
unification.123.desc:0 "For the first time since The Fall happened, the Holy Cross Voivodeship finds itself at peace, a fact grandly announced in the capital of Kielce today. A great parade, modeled after the Independence Marches of years past rolled through the city in front of tens of thousands of onlookers, Robert Bąkiewicz at its helm –  a man who turned a fringe movement into an unstoppable militia, himself coming from near ruin to national fame. Behind him, in lock-step march the soldiers of the Holy Cross Society – loyal fanatics fighting for a Poland defined by national strength and rejection of western degeneracy. \nYet further – the prisoners of war, serving one final purpose of showcasing their humiliation. Rights previously enjoyed by the populace are being rolled back to combat the "dangerous changes brought by German influence", as waves of refugees pour through the borders of the region, with persecution against all who are not of pure Polish blood intensifying since the conquest of the voivodeship."
