calisia.2.t: "Behind the Purple Curtains"
calisia.2.desc: " - What will the Emperor do know? - Konrad, one of the royal servants, unable to cope with the lingering stress bursted out.\n - I heard, he plans to reform the system of public land - his colleague tried to ease his companion's worries.\n - Oh Kacper, don't be ridic... - despite the distress he restrained himself, from saying something that could offend the Emperor. No one knew who could be overhearing them. - I mean, why would he?\n - Why, he was the one who curtailed the corrupt clergy and took their land. - Kacper backed up his case - He cares for the poor./n - But redistributing it to the masses - Konrad tried to be much more careful with his words now - That would contradict his previous actions. He used those lands to appease the soldiers and the financial elite.\n\nThe conversation went on for some time and just as Kacper feared someone indeed was spying on them and many other servants. Imperator Ricardus Calisius ordered his agents to overhear the rumors surrounding him. To find any traces of a conspiracy and... to satisfy his ego. Dominus bathed in the attention he was getting from the servants, soldiers, and senators alike. All unsure about his next move. The light of the imperial glory however cannot outshine the burining flame of corruption, that began to slowly consume his domain. Something meaningful had to be done.\nSomething inside him wanted a drastic action to help the poor masses. A memory etched beyond the edge of his mind. A memory of the red and gold standards of a bygone empire, but not of the old Rome. Something more recent. Something he knew more... intimately.\nCalisius took a sip of his favorite Lazio wine to calm his troubled mind. Whatever noble intentions he may have had, he had to realize that the wealthy senators were the ones who could finance his state and provide economic progress. Still, the excesses of the corrupt quaestors had to be stopped even if he ultimately took the side of the aristocracy in the brewing conflict.\nOne thing was certain, he had to break the silence and implement reforms, either revolutionary or evolutionary to the Ager Publicus system. His postponement of the matter raised the tension and expectations so high the gods on Olympus were aware of them. He'll have to deliver a speech great enough to meet those expectations."

calisia.3.t: "On Their Knees"
calisia.3.desc: "- ...and according to my worker's measurements, the car should have easily passed through and made it into the room! We've cut out half the east wall specifically for this! \n- ...oh Jesus-Christ-Jupiter just... go. Begone. Thanks. \n- O- o-o-of-of-of course. Ave Calisius... \n\nThe emperor was tired of this whole mess already. For the past 3 hours he's been listening to the panic and stutter of ashamed senators who failed to fit in the ceremony's theme, and his bum was really starting to hurt from sitting in the same position for all this time. \nThe fools who already laid their gifts in front of him also weren't helping - they've clumped themselves together in one of the hall's corners and were now bickering between each other about their incompetence and lack of organization. Some of them came to the ceremony with birthday cups and hats, others packed their gifts like Christmas presents, and some were even ostentatiously throwing themselves at the emperor's feet. And they were doing it the wrong way, too - as if he was a pharaoh, not an Augustus. \n\nAll, however, were beaten in their idiocy by certain two stooges: the one who decided to enter the hall in *great style*, whom the emperor've just dismissed after the Scoda Superbus meant as a gift to him failed to fit in the specially prepared hole in the room's wall, nearly robbing the Tłokinia Palace off of its restaurant wing's roof, and Jakub - previously a student, nowadays Calisius' personal aide (or maid, rather), who risked getting trampled to death by a crowd of senators and their guards leaving the hall just to present his ruler with a toaster. A fucking *toaster*. \n\nThe paralympics in sucking up to the emperor lasted for another hour or two, until the last senator promptly stormed out of the building after bestowing the throne with a pair of anti-slip socks and an Angry Birds-themed bedding set. Finally - the palace was emptied of any civil servants, a small wave of servants flooding the building's rooms in their stead. Immedeatly, Calisius himself started manually delegating them to various tasks in a tired, irritated voice. \n- You. Get a brush and tidy the shelves. You, you and you - deal with shit on the tables. You three will handle the floor. You! Call whatever builders still working at this time of the day and tell 'em to patch up the goddamn wall, and *YOU*, Jakub..."

calisia.4.t: "The Unelightened Masses..."
calisia.4.desc: "Andrzej Kompa and Rafał Chwedoruk or Andreas Kompa and Raphael Hevodorukus as they were called while addressing the Emperor started a meeting to hear the report of how the bestowments of gifts to Calisius went.\n - Great, oh [urząd], everything went fine completely. Hehe.\n - Get out! - Kompa saw through the lies of the emissary. - Had it not been for the avalanche of work I had to do, I'd have gone there myself and done it properly.\nIndeed, as a qualified historian of late antiquity, Kompa was the perfect candidate to navigate the meanders of courtly etiquette. Even though he mainly specialized in the Byzantine history.\n - At this point, we'll never convince Calisius to implement our plans - Lamented Hevodorukus.\n - Your plans, you mean? - Kompa thought to himself.\nWhile all of the Populares wanted to ease the pain of the poor and democratize the Empire, Hevodorukus was one of the more radical members. He wanted for the workers' syndicates or sodalitates and collegia to be the main form of economic organization.\n - Thank God... or gods, I'm here to temper him - Kompa congratulated himself in his mind. Truth be told together they were quite a political powerhouse with Hevodorukus coming up with the reform programs and Kompa selling them to the Emperor wrapped in the authentic Roman terminology.\nWhile the duo shined at the court, as the intellectuals and outsiders they met certain difficulties while dealing with the supposed backbone of their movement, the lower classes. Of course, they liked their noble, academic presence, but direct interactions were usually quite awkward. That's why they had the men for the dirty work. When they needed to appease a local mayor they usually sent someone like Silvius Iacobinus, an elder of Ferrerum to visit him with alcohol et ecce, you've got a mayor on your side. However, even Iacobinus can't be everywhere and drink alcohol with all of the imperial subjects (despite what he claims). That's why someone like the leader of the legionaries, Marcus Vinicius would be a great asset to Populares' cause. Would be, as, despite his formal allegiance to the faction, he cares little for it, preferring to focus on his service to the Emperor, while remaining apolitical.\n - OK, the show's over! - ruled Kompa - Everyone, get back to work. If the Optimates faces the same problem as we do, our government may yet hold to power."

calisia.9.t: "Bills for the Donativum"
calisia.9.desc: "– You had shown great wisdom in picking me as your engraver, oh Emperor. \nTruth be told, the young man in question was the sole male pupil of art high school that admitted to thinking about Roman Empire. And he worked for less than minimal wage. \n– Enough with the talk. Show me your projects! – Calisius commanded. \nA few bills were set before him. On averse, there was the usual profile of emperor, on the reverse – the depictions of Legion’s crossing the Prosna on a makeshift bridge, capturing a tank or fighting barbarians. \n– Is that a German? Beaten on the helmet? Timeless classic. I’m sure the men will appreciate these. \n– Oh Emperor! You honor me, but please, reconsider whom you will reward. Those legionaries are dirty scoundrels, and their Vinicius is a good-for-nothing. Don’t let those bills fall into their dirty hands; they’ll squander them in one day. The pretorians, on the other hand, would-  \n– I know full well I’ll see this money once in my life and never again. The true problem is the feast for whoever gets the donativum. \n– You mean, oh divine? \n– The legionaries would prolly appreciate a whole load of huge, cheap Polish-style pizza. Greasy, thick, with a shitload of cheese. Plus a ton of cheap wine. Jabol, even. I’m not sure if this is what we want to strive for. Bread, circus and orgy all day long – Kalisz sighed. – Meanwhile, the pretorians would expect an actual Napoletana, and while I do enjoy a good Napoletana, it’s a bit on the nose. These men are thugs, first and foremost, and they won’t distinguish a good Umbrian wine from Żabka’s Fresco. They just want wealth, and with it, power. \n\nThe emperor grabbed a bill to wipe out sweat from his forehead. No matter whom he would choose..."

calisia.12.t: "Lex Ager Publicus"
calisia.12.desc: ""
calisia.12.a: "Tba"

calisia.13.t: "Gracchus' Gall"
calisia.13.desc: "Another gathering of the Senate, another few hours of listening to other Senators speak with audibly forced eloquence about the need to make a dog park somewhere in the middle of nowhere. Normally Consul Andreas Kompa would be bored out of his mind, dozing off, exchanging glares with some optimates, or simply chatting with other senators to either of his sides, however today he had no time for meaningless chatter. In fact, he didn’t have much time for anything, as he sat there stressfully clenching a small file of papers in his hands. Kompa was given the dubious honor of delivering a speech that could either kickstart, or kill the idea of reforming the Ager Publicus on arrival. Time flew by him, and soon enough it was finally his time to speak before his colleagues. He stood up and with the weight of the world crashing down upon his shoulders, stepped up to the podium. \n\n- The issue that I will be talking about today is one of grave importance. I speak today not as a populares, but instead as a senator concerned with the current ongoing crisis. As I assume you all know, recent findings have uncovered many inefficiencies and flaws in the system of Ager Publicus. Plebes working the lands of certain patricians and even some senators have been found to be exploited, overworked and unfairly rewarded for their labor. On top of that, cases of tax reports meant to fund the Res Publica being falsified have also been uncovered.\n\nMurmurs spread through the Senate hall, each quiet on their own, but gathering into a deafening clamor. The loudest and seemingly most concerned of the whispers spread from the seats occupied by the optimates. Before the noise could grow any louder, Kompa cleared his throat, returning the hall’s attention back to himself. As he continued to speak, he locked eyes with one man in particular: Petrus Caletus, the unofficial leader of the optimates.\n\n- A glaring problem within this whole ordeal is the inexcusable behavior of the optimates. Ever since the news of overreaches within the Ager Publicus have been brought to light, they haven’t done as much as lifted a finger in the way of fixing this problem. These actions speak louder than words and every Calisian will be well aware of their inaction. It’s really not surprising seeing them in this position; most cases of corruption and exploitation to varying degrees have been noted in properties owned directly, or indirectly by members of the optimates.\n\nKompa couldn’t help but feel accomplished, seeing the face of Consul Caletus drop from a veneer of confidence to a grimace of poorly bottled up rage. Murmurs once again drowned out any other noise within the hall, this time interspersed with chuckles from the side of the populares. This time, the murmurs dispersed on their own after a short while, letting the Consul continue unimpeded.\n\n- However, members of the populares are not guilt-free. Despite what some in this hall may think, this is not a reason to squabble amongst each other. Ager Publicus is flawed and we, as humble servants of the Res Publica must work to fix it. The fact of the matter is however, that reform..."

calisia.18.desc: "– And what the fuck is that supposed to be? \nPraefectus Quintus looked in disbelief as a rank of bathrobe-clad horsemen in baggy pants stood before him. Some of the men had Andean style caps; the kind of which, in better times, was associated with then-prime minister Tusk. Others sported makeshift helmets and silvery fishscale overalls, which – apparently – were supposed to resemble lamellar armour. \n– You bunch of barbarian maggots ever heard of thermae or razors? – the prefect asked. \n– With all due respect, good sire – the horsemen leader rode forward – we were not keen on losing our identity, and our considerable facial hair, under new government. But, well, as we were recognised as equites of the empire, we, uh, found ourselves in need to adapt. We are still Sarmatians, only the ancient kind. The real one, if you prefer, good sire. \n\nThe silence was as uncomfortable as lamellar overalls. After a longer while, a young optio broke out. \n– Quintus... Quintus, don’t irritate yourself... \n– How I’m supposed not to irritate? \n– Easy, they’ll latinize... \n– They won’t latinize! Nothing will latinize! I won’t get another equites like that! We were supposed to recruit a good bunch of horsemen and not some steppe throatsinger wannabies! I bet they can’t even do Parthian shot! \n\nAs on command, a few arrows flew towards the Roman delegation. They missed, Quintus thought for a second, until his horse tumbled down and he slammed his face in mud. Sarmatian leader rode closer, twirling his moustache."

calisia.19.desc: "It was not the first time Leszczyński family had their estates seized, but it could well be the last one. \n\nAs the loud blare of trumpets neared, count Wojciech readied his last stand, with his servants brandishing sabres, swords and whatever sharp object they could find. The gates of palace was shut, and in each window, a rifleman waited for the command to open fire. \n\nRumour had it a whole legion was sent to capture the estates. How fitting that the Lechite monarchy was to be ended by its eternal Roman enemies! Or maybe not, the count thought. The cause of the Lechites would be taken up by another warlord elsewhere in Poland. There’s no need to be dramatic about it. \n\nAs Leszczyński walked through the halls of his palace, he noticed the portrait of his great ancestor, king of Poland, great duke of Lithuania, prince of Lotharingia Stanisław Leszczyński. His deeds and struggles imbued him with inspiration. The count stopped for a while and pondered. What would Leszczyński do? \n\nAnd so, Wojciech Edward I Leszczyński bailed the fuck out of his palace and escaped to France."

Then the parishioners of Turek went out and conspired to save as much money as they could. They sent their envoys to the priest. \n\n"Father” they said, “we know that you are honest and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You seek favor from no one, because you pay no attention to pagan rituals. So tell us what you think: Is it right to donate new money for the collection tray?” \n\nThe priest saw their good intent and said, „Well, there is no need to withhold it from me. Show me the coin you want to donate.” \n\nAnd they brought him a denarius. „Whose image is this”, priest asked, „and whose inscription?” \n\n„Caesar’s,” they answered. \n\n „You’re sure? He looks kinda thin. Anyway, it will do”. \n\nAnd then the parishioners said: „but father, did Jesus not say we should render unto Caesar what is Caesar’s?” So they left him and went away. \n\n „Terribly clever of you”, the priest shouted after them, „Caesar won’t see shit of these coins! You’ve studied tax fraud since the times of Leszek Miller!”"

Zmodernizowane reformy rzymskie. Armia legionistów, monety z fasadą cesarza i nowe marmurowe budynki, które wkrótce zostaną wzniesione w niedawno zromanizowanych miastach, naprawdę sprawiają wrażenie przeniesionych w odległą przeszłość. Czas pokaże, co z tego wyniknie stan pseudorzymskich rekonstruktorów, choć jest rzeczą oczywistą, że nawet jeśli ich szaleństwo dobiegnie końca, państwo polsko-rzymskie niewątpliwie zapisze się w historii jako kolejne na długiej liście dziwactw wynikających z Upadku."

Despite relative economic weakness and sparse population, through a sequence of carefully planned offensives, the heavily disciplined legions of the Neo-Roman state managed to subdue the local warlords, entering the capital of Łódź in a wave of glory, followed by a grand Triumfal procession along the city’s main Piotrkowska street. \n\nFollowing the conquest, by the Emperor’s decree, the land has been divided up into new provinces in preparation for the Romanization of the Caesar’s new subjects, and from among those who embraced the cultured ways of their new rulers, new cohorts are being established to bolster the army in preparation for the next campaigns."

Through a string of increasingly grand triumphs, the elite cohorts have successfully spread civilization to the barbarians of Pomerania, with even the greatest strongholds falling to the imperial army. As with Navis before, the region is undergoing a massive Romanization campaign to bring culture to the poor illiterate brutes and welcome them as imperial subjects. The victorious soldiers and generals have been greatly rewarded for their success, with those who’ve distinguished themselves in combat granted generous swathes of land and the Imperator’s closest followers appointed as consuls of the new provinces. Once the territory has been fully integrated and the army strengthened with new recruits, the legions stand ready for their greatest campaign yet – the march on Varsovia."

After a decade of post-Fall anarchy, the nation has been fully reunified under the so-called Imperator Ricardus Calisius, a former SLD politician turned monarch. After crowning himself the emperor of the crumbling city of Kalisz, the Caesar earned the public’s favor, rebuilding the city in a neoclassical style from a pile of rubble into a truly worthy capital. With dozens of loyal legions under his command and the spirit of Augustus coursing through his veins, the great conqueror managed to subdue the entirety of the country, not even the barbarian kings of Varsovia and Cracovia able to stop his advance. \n\nFollowing the final Triumh, a grand celebration ensued with Calisian wine flowing in unending excess. The task ahead remains monumental, however, as rebuilding the ruined economy and Romanizing the millions of new citizens may prove to be an even greater challenge. \n\nThe Empire of Calisia shall ensure its eternal place in the sun!"

POLITICS_RICARDUS_CALISIUS_DESC: "For all of his life Ryszard Kalisz felt some kind of yearning in the back of his mind. He could feel it while walking past inscribed with legal maxims columns of the Supreme Court, watching Asterix and Obelix: Mission Cleopatra or eating pizza. Whenever he held a speech, be it in court or in Sejm, he could feel behind him the presence of someone far greater and wiser then jury or Marshal of the Sejm. He dismissed it and carried on. Former socialist, lawyer, politician – hardly the most respectable cursus honorum, although typical. \n\nIt was right after the collapse his inner consciousness had awoken. Running away (either from the blast or the angered mob), he hid himself in a wine cellar in Kalisz. Whatever happened there will be forever shrouded in mystery. On the third day he emerged, draped in a bedsheet tinted purple with Lazio wine, with a golden laurel on his head and perfect knowledge of all five Latin declinations. \n\nHowever odd Kalisz wouldn’t seem, locals did greatly appreciate his restlessness and talent for reorganisation. No one batted an eye when he ordered construction of an aqueduct or organising games in the amphitheatre. However, when he proclaimed himself divine regent of Jupiter, some people thought he might be going too far. By this stage, however, his rule was cemented. Kalisz approached members of local elites and offered them an attractive deal: land in exchange for political power. Soon afterwards senate convened and proclaimed Kalisz – now Ricardus Romanus Calisius – first a consul for life, and soon after – the emperor of Calisia. The new dictator’s first edict shocked many to the bone: he denounced Christianity in favour of paganism and ordered confiscation of the Church lands to create a reserve of public land for the bene meritorum. \n\nKalisz walks a tightrope between the optimate faction, which looks forward to seizing as much wealth as possible, and the populares, who point out to crying inequality in the nascent empire. The conflict is spiced up by uncertainty about Calisius’ mental state. As mad as he seems, he refurbished this piece of post-collapse Poland into a strong, well functioning statelet. His past made many think he’d turn out to be an opportunist, but his decision to crack down on the Catholic Church proved he isn’t afraid to cross the Rubicon. The true extent of emperor’s ambition – or folly – will be soon known..."
POLITICS_pawel_delag_DESC: "Once upon a time an actor named Paweł Deląg played a bad-boy-turned-good-guy Marcus Vinicius in a grandiose ancient Rome epic called Quo Vadis. Thus he earned a certain fame and reputation as „Poland sexiest actor of 2001”, while helping shape the image of a gory, immoral Roman Empire transforming into a more humane, Christian Europe. \n\nThat’s perhaps why Deląg, as soon as atomic dust settled, moved where ruins were modern and reconstruction was ancient.\n\nIt’s hard to assume whether he offered his service to Calisius out of conviction, lust for power or pure opportunism, or was simply bought. Nonetheless, placed at the helm of the legions, he quickly became the icon of the regime, most likely because he was the one who truly seemed like he was the right man in the right place. The people listen to his words, and the affection with which legionaries follow him would be hard to outweigh with money. Magnanimous, outgoing and tolerant, Vinicius quickly became a leader of the popular faction, believing that the new Eternal City can be a place where everyone can be a citizen of equal rights and duties; where bread and circuses serve a better purpose than controlling the masses. \n\nMarcus’ charm and popularity act like a column holding Calisius’ regime standing. It would seem the emperor’s past makes him sympathetic to popular ideas. The caesar could not think of a better friend... But can a friendship last forever?"
