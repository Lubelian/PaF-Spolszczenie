calisia.2.t: "Behind the Purple Curtains"
calisia.2.desc: " - What will the Emperor do know? - Konrad, one of the royal servants, unable to cope with the lingering stress bursted out.\n - I heard, he plans to reform the system of public land - his colleague tried to ease his companion's worries.\n - Oh Kacper, don't be ridic... - despite the distress he restrained himself, from saying something that could offend the Emperor. No one knew who could be overhearing them. - I mean, why would he?\n - Why, he was the one who curtailed the corrupt clergy and took their land. - Kacper backed up his case - He cares for the poor./n - But redistributing it to the masses - Konrad tried to be much more careful with his words now - That would contradict his previous actions. He used those lands to appease the soldiers and the financial elite.\n\nThe conversation went on for some time and just as Kacper feared someone indeed was spying on them and many other servants. Imperator Ricardus Calisius ordered his agents to overhear the rumors surrounding him. To find any traces of a conspiracy and... to satisfy his ego. Dominus bathed in the attention he was getting from the servants, soldiers, and senators alike. All unsure about his next move. The light of the imperial glory however cannot outshine the burining flame of corruption, that began to slowly consume his domain. Something meaningful had to be done.\nSomething inside him wanted a drastic action to help the poor masses. A memory etched beyond the edge of his mind. A memory of the red and gold standards of a bygone empire, but not of the old Rome. Something more recent. Something he knew more... intimately.\nCalisius took a sip of his favorite Lazio wine to calm his troubled mind. Whatever noble intentions he may have had, he had to realize that the wealthy senators were the ones who could finance his state and provide economic progress. Still, the excesses of the corrupt quaestors had to be stopped even if he ultimately took the side of the aristocracy in the brewing conflict.\nOne thing was certain, he had to break the silence and implement reforms, either revolutionary or evolutionary to the Ager Publicus system. His postponement of the matter raised the tension and expectations so high the gods on Olympus were aware of them. He'll have to deliver a speech great enough to meet those expectations."

calisia.3.t: "Niedostojni dostojnicy"
calisia.3.desc: "- ...i zaprawdę *przysięgam* ci, o Cesarzu, że według obliczeń zatrudnionych przeze mnie robotników auto powinno móc bez problemu zmieścić się w wjeździe! To specjalnie pod nie usunęliśmy połowę wschodniej ściany! \n- ...oh Jezu, Chryste, Jowiszu, po prostu... odejdź. Idź stąd. Dzięki. \n- O- o-o-o-oczywiście. Ave Calisius... \n\nCesarz Calisius był już mocno znużony. Od 3 godzin słuchał jąkania i paniki zakłopotanych senatorów nie umiejących przystosować się do konwencji ceremonii. \nHarmider dobiegający z przeciwległego konta również nie pomagał - to senatorzy burzyli się na siebie nawzajem o swoje niedopasowane do okazji stroje i ogólną niekompetencję i nieprzygotowanie: część z nich przyszła z urodzinowymi czapeczkami i kubkami na napoje, część przyniosła świąteczne prezenty, a nie dostojne dary, a jeszcze co po niektórzy podczas składania darów ostentacyjnie rzucali się przed tron na ziemię, i to na dodatek w złym - bo jak przed faraona, a nie cesarza rzymskiego - stylu. \nNajgorsze prawdopodobnie i tak było siedzenie w tej samej pozycji przez tak długi czas, od czego cesarza najzwyczajniej w świecie bardzo mocno rozbolała dupa. \n\nO ile każdy senator zdołał coś spieprzyć, o tyle wszystkich i tak zdołało przebić dwóch zawadiaków: ten którego właśnie odprawił, który postanowił *w wielkim stylu* podarować mu samochód, ale składana w hołdzie Scoda Superbus w cabrio nie zmieściła się w specjalnie zrobionym dla niej wjeździe i zaryła bokami w ściany, niemal pozbawiając pałacyk w Tłokinii Kościelnej dachu swojej restauracyjnej dobudówki, oraz Jakub - dawniej student, a obecnie personalna służka cesarza, który jakimś cudem zdołał przedrzeć się przez zastęp senatorów i ich strażników wychodzących właśnie z sali by złożyć swojemu panu w podarunku toster. Jebany. Kurwa. Toster.\n\nParaolimpiada w podlizywaniu się cesarzowi trwała jeszcze przez niecałe dwie godziny, aż do momentu gdy ostatni senator opuścił pośpiesznie salę po przekazaniu mu torby sportowej zawierającej pościel z ptakami z Angry Birds i parę antypoślizgowych skarpetek. Nareszcie, urzędnicy państwowi opuścili salę a na ich miejsce wkroczyła zwykła służba, którą mocno już zmęczony władca natychmiast oddelegował do odpowiednich zadań zirytowanym, karcącym tonem.\n- Ty. Weź tę zmiotkę i zmieć ten syf z półek. Ty, ty i ty - posprzątajcie syf z podłogi, a wy trzej ogarnijcie stoły. Ty zadzwoń po jakąś budowlankę żeby przyszli załatać te dziurę w ścianie, a *TY*, Jakubie..."

calisia.4.t: "The Unelightened Masses..."
calisia.4.desc: "Andrzej Kompa and Rafał Chwedoruk or Andreas Kompa and Raphael Hevodorukus as they were called while addressing the Emperor started a meeting to hear the report of how the bestowments of gifts to Calisius went.\n - Great, oh [urząd], everything went fine completely. Hehe.\n - Get out! - Kompa saw through the lies of the emissary. - Had it not been for the avalanche of work I had to do, I'd have gone there myself and done it properly.\nIndeed, as a qualified historian of late antiquity, Kompa was the perfect candidate to navigate the meanders of courtly etiquette. Even though he mainly specialized in the Byzantine history.\n - At this point, we'll never convince Calisius to implement our plans - Lamented Hevodorukus.\n - Your plans, you mean? - Kompa thought to himself.\nWhile all of the Populares wanted to ease the pain of the poor and democratize the Empire, Hevodorukus was one of the more radical members. He wanted for the workers' syndicates or sodalitates and collegia to be the main form of economic organization.\n - Thank God... or gods, I'm here to temper him - Kompa congratulated himself in his mind. Truth be told together they were quite a political powerhouse with Hevodorukus coming up with the reform programs and Kompa selling them to the Emperor wrapped in the authentic Roman terminology.\nWhile the duo shined at the court, as the intellectuals and outsiders they met certain difficulties while dealing with the supposed backbone of their movement, the lower classes. Of course, they liked their noble, academic presence, but direct interactions were usually quite awkward. That's why they had the men for the dirty work. When they needed to appease a local mayor they usually sent someone like Silvius Iacobinus, an elder of Ferrerum to visit him with alcohol et ecce, you've got a mayor on your side. However, even Iacobinus can't be everywhere and drink alcohol with all of the imperial subjects (despite what he claims). That's why someone like the leader of the legionaries, Marcus Vinicius would be a great asset to Populares' cause. Would be, as, despite his formal allegiance to the faction, he cares little for it, preferring to focus on his service to the Emperor, while remaining apolitical.\n - OK, the show's over! - ruled Kompa - Everyone, get back to work. If the Optimates faces the same problem as we do, our government may yet hold to power."

Zmodernizowane reformy rzymskie. Armia legionistów, monety z fasadą cesarza i nowe marmurowe budynki, które wkrótce zostaną wzniesione w niedawno zromanizowanych miastach, naprawdę sprawiają wrażenie przeniesionych w odległą przeszłość. Czas pokaże, co z tego wyniknie stan pseudorzymskich rekonstruktorów, choć jest rzeczą oczywistą, że nawet jeśli ich szaleństwo dobiegnie końca, państwo polsko-rzymskie niewątpliwie zapisze się w historii jako kolejne na długiej liście dziwactw wynikających z Upadku."

Despite relative economic weakness and sparse population, through a sequence of carefully planned offensives, the heavily disciplined legions of the Neo-Roman state managed to subdue the local warlords, entering the capital of Łódź in a wave of glory, followed by a grand Triumphal procession along the city’s main Piotrkowska street. \n\nFollowing the conquest, by the Emperor’s decree, the land has been divided up into new provinces in preparation for the Romanization of the Caesar’s new subjects, and from among those who embraced the cultured ways of their new rulers, new cohorts are being established to bolster the army in preparation for the next campaigns."

Through a string of increasingly grand triumphs, the elite cohorts have successfully spread civilization to the barbarians of Pomerania, with even the greatest strongholds falling to the imperial army. As with Navis before, the region is undergoing a massive Romanization campaign to bring culture to the poor illiterate brutes and welcome them as imperial subjects. The victorious soldiers and generals have been greatly rewarded for their success, with those who’ve distinguished themselves in combat granted generous swathes of land and the Imperator’s closest followers appointed as consuls of the new provinces. Once the territory has been fully integrated and the army strengthened with new recruits, the legions stand ready for their greatest campaign yet – the march on Varsovia."

After a decade of post-Fall anarchy, the nation has been fully reunified under the so-called Imperator Ricardus Calisius, a former SLD politician turned monarch. After crowning himself the emperor of the crumbling city of Kalisz, the Caesar earned the public’s favor, rebuilding the city in a neoclassical style from a pile of rubble into a truly worthy capital. With dozens of loyal legions under his command and the spirit of Augustus coursing through his veins, the great conqueror managed to subdue the entirety of the country, not even the barbarian kings of Varsovia and Cracovia able to stop his advance. \n\nFollowing the final Triumh, a grand celebration ensued with Calisian wine flowing in unending excess. The task ahead remains monumental, however, as rebuilding the ruined economy and Romanizing the millions of new citizens may prove to be an even greater challenge. \n\nThe Empire of Calisia shall ensure its eternal place in the sun!"

##Characters##
POLITICS_RICARDUS_CALISIUS_DESC: "For all of his life Ryszard Kalisz felt some kind of yearning in the back of his mind. He could feel it while walking past inscribed with legal maxims columns of the Supreme Court, watching Asterix and Obelix: Mission Cleopatra or eating pizza. Whenever he held a speech, be it in court or in Sejm, he could feel behind him the presence of someone far greater and wiser then jury or Marshal of the Sejm. He dismissed it and carried on. Former socialist, lawyer, politician – hardly the most respectable cursus honorum, although typical. \n\nIt was right after the collapse his inner consciousness had awoken. Running away (either from the blast or the angered mob), he hid himself in a wine cellar in Kalisz. Whatever happened there will be forever shrouded in mystery. On the third day he emerged, draped in a bedsheet tinted purple with Lazio wine, with a golden laurel on his head and perfect knowledge of all five Latin declinations. \n\nHowever odd Kalisz wouldn’t seem, locals did greatly appreciate his restlessness and talent for reorganisation. No one batted an eye when he ordered construction of an aqueduct or organising games in the amphitheatre. However, when he proclaimed himself divine regent of Jupiter, some people thought he might be going too far. By this stage, however, his rule was cemented. Kalisz approached members of local elites and offered them an attractive deal: land in exchange for political power. Soon afterwards senate convened and proclaimed Kalisz – now Ricardus Romanus Calisius – first a consul for life, and soon after – the emperor of Calisia. The new dictator’s first edict shocked many to the bone: he denounced Christianity in favour of paganism and ordered confiscation of the Church lands to create a reserve of public land for the bene meritorum. \n\nKalisz walks a tightrope between the optimate faction, which looks forward to seizing as much wealth as possible, and the populares, who point out to crying inequality in the nascent empire. The conflict is spiced up by uncertainty about Calisius’ mental state. As mad as he seems, he refurbished this piece of post-collapse Poland into a strong, well functioning statelet. His past made many think he’d turn out to be an opportunist, but his decision to crack down on the Catholic Church proved he isn’t afraid to cross the Rubicon. The true extent of emperor’s ambition – or folly – will be soon known..."
POLITICS_pawel_delag_DESC: "Once upon a time an actor named Paweł Deląg played a bad-boy-turned-good-guy Marcus Vinicius in a grandiose ancient Rome epic called Quo Vadis. Thus he earned a certain fame and reputation as „Poland sexiest actor of 2001”, while helping shape the image of a gory, immoral Roman Empire transforming into a more humane, Christian Europe. \n\nThat’s perhaps why Deląg, as soon as atomic dust settled, moved where ruins were modern and reconstruction was ancient.\n\nIt’s hard to assume whether he offered his service to Calisius out of conviction, lust for power or pure opportunism, or was simply bought. Nonetheless, placed at the helm of the legions, he quickly became the icon of the regime, most likely because he was the one who truly seemed like he was the right man in the right place. The people listen to his words, and the affection with which legionaries follow him would be hard to outweigh with money. Magnanimous, outgoing and tolerant, Vinicius quickly became a leader of the popular faction, believing that the new Eternal City can be a place where everyone can be a citizen of equal rights and duties; where bread and circuses serve a better purpose than controlling the masses. \n\nMarcus’ charm and popularity act like a column holding Calisius’ regime standing. It would seem the emperor’s past makes him sympathetic to popular ideas. The caesar could not think of a better friend… But can a friendship last forever?"
