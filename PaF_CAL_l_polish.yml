Consul Andreas Kompa makes a fiery speech on corruption and thievery consuming the Ager Publicus system from inside, sparking a heated and unorganized debate on the situation. According to Consul Kompa, grave amounts of money, workforce and resources have been treacherously embezzled by public land administrators through sale and redistribution of public land. Tens of thousands of people have suffered shortages and underpayments from the clerks abusing the Calisian state apparatus, and zealous punishments are to be settled upon and rightfully executed on those dishonest and disrespectful of Calisia and its People.

calisia.2.desc: " - What will the Emperor do know? - Konrad, one of the royal servants, unable to cope with the lingering stress bursted out.\n - I heard, he plans to reform the system of public land - his colleague tried to ease his companion's worries.\n - Oh Kacper, don't be ridic... - despite the distress he restrained himself, from saying something that could offend the Emperor. No one knew who could be overhearing them. - I mean, why would he?\n - Why, he was the one who curtailed the corrupt clergy and took their land. - Kacper backed up his case - He cares for the poor./n - But redistributing it to the masses - Konrad tried to be much more careful with his words now - That would contradict his previous actions. He used those lands to appease the soldiers and the financial elite.\n\nThe conversation went on for some time and just as Kacper feared someone indeed was spying on them and many other servants. Imperator Ricardus Calisius ordered his agents to overhear the rumors surrounding him. To find any traces of a conspiracy and... to satisfy his ego. Dominus bathed in the attention he was getting from the servants, soldiers, and senators alike. All unsure about his next move. The light of the imperial glory however cannot outshine the burining flame of corruption, that began to slowly consume his domain. Something meaningful had to be done.\nSomething inside him wanted a drastic action to help the poor masses. A memory etched beyond the edge of his mind. A memory of the red and gold standards of a bygone empire, but not of the old Rome. Something more recent. Something he knew more... intimately.\nCalisius took a sip of his favorite Lazio wine to calm his troubled mind. Whatever noble intentions he may have had, he had to realize that the wealthy senators were the ones who could finance his state and provide economic progress. Still, the excesses of the corrupt quaestors had to be stopped even if he ultimately took the side of the aristocracy in the brewing conflict.\nOne thing was certain, he had to break the silence and implement reforms, either revolutionary or evolutionary to the Ager Publicus system. His postponement of the matter raised the tension and expectations so high the gods on Olympus were aware of them. He'll have to deliver a speech great enough to meet those expectations."

calisia.3.desc: "- ...and according to my worker's measurements, the car should have easily passed through and made it into the room! We've cut out half the east wall specifically for this! \n- ...oh Jesus-Christ-Jupiter just... go. Begone. Thanks. \n- O- o-o-of-of-of course. Ave Calisius... \n\nThe emperor was tired of this whole mess already. For the past 3 hours he's been listening to the panic and stutter of ashamed senators who failed to fit in the ceremony's theme, and his bum was really starting to hurt from sitting in the same position for all this time. \nThe fools who already laid their gifts in front of him also weren't helping - they've clumped themselves together in one of the hall's corners and were now bickering between each other about their incompetence and lack of organization. Some of them came to the ceremony with birthday cups and hats, others packed their gifts like Christmas presents, and some were even ostentatiously throwing themselves at the emperor's feet. And they were doing it the wrong way, too - as if he was a pharaoh, not an Augustus. \n\nAll, however, were beaten in their idiocy by certain two stooges: the one who decided to enter the hall in *great style*, whom the emperor've just dismissed after the Scoda Superbus meant as a gift to him failed to fit in the specially prepared hole in the room's wall, nearly robbing the Tłokinia Palace off of its restaurant wing's roof, and Jakub - previously a student, nowadays Calisius' personal aide (or maid, rather), who risked getting trampled to death by a crowd of senators and their guards leaving the hall just to present his ruler with a toaster. A fucking *toaster*. \n\nThe paralympics in sucking up to the emperor lasted for another hour or two, until the last senator promptly stormed out of the building after bestowing the throne with a pair of anti-slip socks and an Angry Birds-themed bedding set. Finally - the palace was emptied of any civil servants, a small wave of servants flooding the building's rooms in their stead. Immedeatly, Calisius himself started manually delegating them to various tasks in a tired, irritated voice. \n- You. Get a brush and tidy the shelves. You, you and you - deal with shit on the tables. You three will handle the floor. You! Call whatever builders still working at this time of the day and tell 'em to patch up the goddamn wall, and *YOU*, Jakub..."

calisia.4.t: "The Unelightened Masses..."
calisia.4.desc: "Andrzej Kompa and Rafał Chwedoruk or Andreas Kompa and Raphael Hevodorukus as they were called while addressing the Emperor started a meeting to hear the report of how the bestowments of gifts to Calisius went.\n - Great, oh [urząd], everything went fine completely. Hehe.\n - Get out! - Kompa saw through the lies of the emissary. - Had it not been for the avalanche of work I had to do, I'd have gone there myself and done it properly.\nIndeed, as a qualified historian of late antiquity, Kompa was the perfect candidate to navigate the meanders of courtly etiquette. Even though he mainly specialized in the Byzantine history.\n - At this point, we'll never convince Calisius to implement our plans - Lamented Hevodorukus.\n - Your plans, you mean? - Kompa thought to himself.\nWhile all of the Populares wanted to ease the pain of the poor and democratize the Empire, Hevodorukus was one of the more radical members. He wanted for the workers' syndicates or sodalitates and collegia to be the main form of economic organization.\n - Thank God... or gods, I'm here to temper him - Kompa congratulated himself in his mind. Truth be told together they were quite a political powerhouse with Hevodorukus coming up with the reform programs and Kompa selling them to the Emperor wrapped in the authentic Roman terminology.\nWhile the duo shined at the court, as the intellectuals and outsiders they met certain difficulties while dealing with the supposed backbone of their movement, the lower classes. Of course, they liked their noble, academic presence, but direct interactions were usually quite awkward. That's why they had the men for the dirty work. When they needed to appease a local mayor they usually sent someone like Silvius Iacobinus, an elder of Ferrerum to visit him with alcohol et ecce, you've got a mayor on your side. However, even Iacobinus can't be everywhere and drink alcohol with all of the imperial subjects (despite what he claims). That's why someone like the leader of the legionaries, Marcus Vinicius would be a great asset to Populares' cause. Would be, as, despite his formal allegiance to the faction, he cares little for it, preferring to focus on his service to the Emperor, while remaining apolitical.\n - OK, the show's over! - ruled Kompa - Everyone, get back to work. If the Optimates faces the same problem as we do, our government may yet hold to power."

unification.31.desc: "In a radio broadcast to all of Greater Poland, an address was given by none other than Ryszard Kalisz; Though anyone who has been around the region can say that the man speaking was no longer the same as everyone knew him before the Fall, going under the name Ricardus Calisius, all signs point to the politician seeking to establish a new Roman Empire in the heart of Poland following this radical change. Through skillfully swaying the local political figures he had managed to become a major contender in the region through semi-modernized Roman reforms. An army of Legionnaires, coinage with the Emperor’s facade and new marble buildings soon to be constructed in recently romanized cities really give off a look of being brought back to the distant past. It remains to be seen what will arise from this state of pseudo-Roman reenactors, though it goes without saying that even if their folly is to end, the Polish-Roman state will no doubt go down in history as another in a long list of oddities resulting from the Fall."

Despite relative economic weakness and sparse population, through a sequence of carefully planned offensives, the heavily disciplined legions of the Neo-Roman state managed to subdue the local warlords, entering the capital of Łódź in a wave of glory, followed by a grand Triumphal procession along the city’s main Piotrkowska street. \n\nFollowing the conquest, by the Emperor’s decree, the land has been divided up into new provinces in preparation for the Romanization of the Caesar’s new subjects, and from among those who embraced the cultured ways of their new rulers, new cohorts are being established to bolster the army in preparation for the next campaigns."

Through a string of increasingly grand triumphs, the elite cohorts have successfully spread civilization to the barbarians of Pomerania, with even the greatest strongholds falling to the imperial army. As with Navis before, the region is undergoing a massive Romanization campaign to bring culture to the poor illiterate brutes and welcome them as imperial subjects. The victorious soldiers and generals have been greatly rewarded for their success, with those who’ve distinguished themselves in combat granted generous swathes of land and the Imperator’s closest followers appointed as consuls of the new provinces. Once the territory has been fully integrated and the army strengthened with new recruits, the legions stand ready for their greatest campaign yet – the march on Varsovia."

super.31.desc: "Shocking news emerge from Poland! After a decade of post-Fall anarchy, the nation has been fully reunified under the so-called Imperator Ricardus Calisius, a former SLD politician turned monarch. After crowning himself the emperor of the crumbling city of Kalisz, the Caesar earned the public’s favor, rebuilding the city in a neoclassical style from a pile of rubble into a truly worthy capital. With dozens of loyal legions under his command and the spirit of Augustus coursing through his veins, the great conqueror managed to subdue the entirety of the country, not even the barbarian kings of Varsovia and Cracovia able to stop his advance. \n\nFollowing the final Triumh, a grand celebration ensued with Calisian wine flowing in unending excess. The task ahead remains monumental, however, as rebuilding the ruined economy and Romanizing the millions of new citizens may prove to be an even greater challenge. \n\nThe Empire of Calisia shall ensure its eternal place in the sun!"

##Characters##
POLITICS_RICARDUS_CALISIUS_DESC: "For all of his life Ryszard Kalisz felt some kind of yearning in the back of his mind. He could feel it while walking past inscribed with legal maxims columns of the Supreme Court, watching Asterix and Obelix: Mission Cleopatra or eating pizza. Whenever he held a speech, be it in court or in Sejm, he could feel behind him the presence of someone far greater and wiser then jury or Marshal of the Sejm. He dismissed it and carried on. Former socialist, lawyer, politician – hardly the most respectable cursus honorum, although typical. \n\nIt was right after the collapse his inner consciousness had awoken. Running away (either from the blast or the angered mob), he hid himself in a wine cellar in Kalisz. Whatever happened there will be forever shrouded in mystery. On the third day he emerged, draped in a bedsheet tinted purple with Lazio wine, with a golden laurel on his head and perfect knowledge of all five Latin declinations. \n\nHowever odd Kalisz wouldn’t seem, locals did greatly appreciate his restlessness and talent for reorganisation. No one batted an eye when he ordered construction of an aqueduct or organising games in the amphitheatre. However, when he proclaimed himself divine regent of Jupiter, some people thought he might be going too far. By this stage, however, his rule was cemented. Kalisz approached members of local elites and offered them an attractive deal: land in exchange for political power. Soon afterwards senate convened and proclaimed Kalisz – now Ricardus Romanus Calisius – first a consul for life, and soon after – the emperor of Calisia. The new dictator’s first edict shocked many to the bone: he denounced Christianity in favour of paganism and ordered confiscation of the Church lands to create a reserve of public land for the bene meritorum. \n\nKalisz walks a tightrope between the optimate faction, which looks forward to seizing as much wealth as possible, and the populares, who point out to crying inequality in the nascent empire. The conflict is spiced up by uncertainty about Calisius’ mental state. As mad as he seems, he refurbished this piece of post-collapse Poland into a strong, well functioning statelet. His past made many think he’d turn out to be an opportunist, but his decision to crack down on the Catholic Church proved he isn’t afraid to cross the Rubicon. The true extent of emperor’s ambition – or folly – will be soon known..."
POLITICS_pawel_delag_DESC: "Once upon a time an actor named Paweł Deląg played a bad-boy-turned-good-guy Marcus Vinicius in a grandiose ancient Rome epic called Quo Vadis. Thus he earned a certain fame and reputation as „Poland sexiest actor of 2001”, while helping shape the image of a gory, immoral Roman Empire transforming into a more humane, Christian Europe. \n\nThat’s perhaps why Deląg, as soon as atomic dust settled, moved where ruins were modern and reconstruction was ancient.\n\nIt’s hard to assume whether he offered his service to Calisius out of conviction, lust for power or pure opportunism, or was simply bought. Nonetheless, placed at the helm of the legions, he quickly became the icon of the regime, most likely because he was the one who truly seemed like he was the right man in the right place. The people listen to his words, and the affection with which legionaries follow him would be hard to outweigh with money. Magnanimous, outgoing and tolerant, Vinicius quickly became a leader of the popular faction, believing that the new Eternal City can be a place where everyone can be a citizen of equal rights and duties; where bread and circuses serve a better purpose than controlling the masses. \n\nMarcus’ charm and popularity act like a column holding Calisius’ regime standing. It would seem the emperor’s past makes him sympathetic to popular ideas. The caesar could not think of a better friend… But can a friendship last forever?"
