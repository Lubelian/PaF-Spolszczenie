PaF_BBW_SMOG_ENDING_TEXT: "A dark abyss beckons in the Heart of Poland - a nightmare of our own creation. Lost in our twisted devotion to progress, we have paid the heaviest price of them all - we have seeped all life from this land, turning everything in our grasp into a smoldering wasteland. The restless flocks flee the crumbling remains of their homes in a desperate search for survival while the corrupted spawn of Ziemkiewicz's ideology fight among themselves to rule over the ashes. Yet there is no Poland left to speak of, just an ominous, low-hanging cloud of suffocating smog and the grim, bare earth beneath it. It will take a thousand years before this poisonous blight can be expunged. Until then, only darkness and misery shall call this region home."
PaF_BBW_ROXI_ENDING_TEXT: "Under Ziemkiewicz's reign, the Brotherhood has repeatedly shown itself to be a destructive force unable to look back at the consequences of its actions. Luckily for Poland, just as the nation teetered on the brink of oblivion, a force from within wrestled the reins of power to save the dying nation. Even to the most cynical eye, the ascent of Roksana Węgiel marks the beginning of a process that will long outlive her - healing. Each day that passes is a victory in its own right, each peaceful morning proof that doomsday has been staved off, at least for now. But this last-minute self-reflection will still have its toll. Poland's survival is not a given. It won't be until the final vestiges of smog are banished from the dusky air, and the last toxic molecules are washed out from the ground."

PaF_ATM_CALL_BERLIN_ENDING_TEXT: "The pen has proven to be mightier than the sword. With a single phone call, Jakub Wiech has upended the balance of power in Europe, forcing Germany into an unwilling submission. The black eagle's wings have been clipped, and in their place, a new force emerges, fuelled by the Atom's near-limitless power. Poland has taken off the shackles imposed by its coal dependency, thrusting itself into the position of a nuclear hegemon. Reborn from post-Fall destitution, the nation rises like an atomic phoenix, its ascent emanated by radioactive glow. The coming decade is sure to prove a challenge. Maintaining authority is far harder than claiming it, and to not rest on one's laurels will require a particularly apt helmsman, but for a visionary such as the Great Ecologist, this victory is not an ending but merely a new beginning."
PaF_ATM_WHAT_BERLIN_ENDING_TEXT: "The cold dagger of revenge twists its way into the heart of Germany. Just as Bałuty burned in nuclear flame nearly twenty years ago, the same fate has now befallen the administrative center of the failed European project - Berlin. In a single precise strike, one of the continent's largest metropolises has been wiped off the map along with its millions of inhabitants. The Germans will claim it was an act of unprecedented terrorism. Their voice matters not. To us, it was an act of just retribution, our return onto the global scale emblazoned in atomic radiance. Our eternal enemy has at last been felled by the victorious Crusaders, and the Polish flag waves proudly along with the French banner on conquered territory. It will stay there until the Germans' hegemonic dreams are completely shattered."
