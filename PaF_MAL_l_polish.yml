POLITICS_LESZEK_BUBEL_DESC:0 "Third time's the charm as many like to say. Though Bubel failed both his attempts at getting elected president of Poland, it seems he wants to try his luck with becoming the supreme chief of the country once again, this time by the sword rather than by pen. As he seized the city of Malbork many more moderate politicians joined his cause, not out of genuine support for his policies, but out of fear for the insanity that other groups in Warmia-Masuria might bring. \n Bubel is in many ways quite a controversial figure, his political campaigning in the 90's and early 2000's could be considered a laughable effort and his activity afterwards sparked many outbursts of anger caused by his rampant anti-semitism. \n \n However all of what happened is irrelevant now, the collapse of the PiS order gave Bubel a chance at redeeming his previous failures, and no longer would his efforts at rebuilding Poland be obstructed by Jewish agents in the Parlament."

unification.93.desc:0 "Through the new-born anarchy of Poland, many failed political movements gained their second chance at relevancy." Has been a statement proven to be many times true with the mass emergence of obscure politicians and ideologies as the centers of the many Polish warlords.  \n One such previously irrelevant politician Leszek Bubel has just reportedly managed to conquer all his rivals in Warmia-Masuria and established a fully functional state made in his vision. \n \n Bubel started out his quest for power in the city of Malbork, which he fashioned into a fortress from which he now rules over all of Warmia. Due to the irrelevancy of Bubel's political activity in the years of a unified Poland not many reacted strongly to his takeover but recently panic began to spread as Leszek's anti-semitic rants from years back became the new basis for many new laws."
