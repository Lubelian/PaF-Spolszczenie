unification.130.desc:0 "Southeastern Poland trembles in fear as more and more refugees and panicked messengers arrive in neighboring lands, all bearing the same distressing news. It appears that the nationalist mutineers of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army – comprised of Azov veterans and other UAF hardliners managed to reach the Vistula, leaving behind a trail of death and destruction. Originating as a rebellion against president Zelenskyy’s order to withdraw following massacres by Polish Russophile guerillas, the units broke all contact with the Humanitarian Mission, instead occupying the lands they controlled and forming a rogue junta. The army’s rule has thus far been described as heavily authoritarian, with Poles and non-compliant minorities suffering under discriminatory policies. \nAs fears rise over possible reprisals for Braunist attacks, the international community prays the Ukrainians will spare the innocent and focus their wrath only on those who *actually* betrayed them."

unificationreg.130.desc:0 "Today, diplomats from cliques located in Podlachia, Mazovia, Lesser Poland and the Holy Cross gathered together on an online conference to discuss the worrying news coming from the other side of their Vistulan borders: The ex-Ukrainian Humanitarian Mission revanchists have conducted a successful offensive along the Bug and Vistula, uniting all of Polish Red Ruthenia under their heel. Although the ruthlessness with which the Ukrainians have expanded their territory has been met with staunch opposition and condemnation from the international community (especially from Russia and Ukraine itself), the reborn UPA has managed to stay afloat and secure enough resources for itself to achieve a semi-autarkic economy, reducing their dependency on supplies from the outside world. Wary of the coming war, border populations have took to mimicking Ukrainians' actions during the Russo-Ukrainian War - fleeing en-masse, organizing fundraisers and preparing traps for the invaders."

unificationsupreg.130.desc:0 "Though Poles have gotten used in the past to having numerous Ukrainian living right next to them, villagers living on the Lesser Polish border have found themselves surprised by the recent influx of Ukrainian-speaking troops forming trench lines and gun emplacements in nearby borderlands. What caught them even more off-guard was mass execution sites left behind in their own dwellings by said newcomers. \n\nThe Ukrainian Insurgent Army continues its brutal expansion into Polish territory, having just seized most of Polish Galicia. The reborn UPA shows no signs of halting, nor does it ease up its brutal policies aimed at Poles, disregarding the international community's continued condemnations and sanctions and living in self-imposed isolation, all in the name of revenge. Judging by the army's attitude and fervor, international observers come to a single conclusion: only a total conquest of Poland will satiate their thirst."
