POLITICS_ALEKSANDRA_DULKIEWICZ_DESC:0 "For some, the decision to betray their country is an obvious one. In this group one can find Aleksandra Dulkiewicz – the mayor of the Free City of Gdańsk. Coming from a bastion of Polish liberalism, and loyal to those beliefs herself, the youthful politician quickly climbed the steps of the political ladder before finally ending up in charge of Poland’s largest coastal city. As much as she wished for her term to be a peaceful one, that wasn’t meant to be, as Mrs. Dulkiewicz found herself increasingly disgusted by the direction her country was heading in. \n\nShe tried to oppose the total political control of PiS. She protested when they tried to centralize power. She even joined the riots when abortion was banned throughout the nation. But no matter what she did, she was powerless to stop the increasingly authoritarian government. And just as Dulkiewicz was about to give up on her attempts, she was handed the greatest chance of her lifetime. \n\nWhen the German invasion came, she didn’t hesitate for even a second before she took the deal with the devil and delivered Mr. Tusk the city of Gdańsk on a silver platter. Finally, she would make things right, help rebuild Poland from the ground up and who cares if it’s under the boot of the Germans? Anything was better than PiS. Surely her countrymen would understand. Surely. \n\nAnd yet, the occupiers failed, with the mayor of Gdańsk now finding herself increasingly isolated in the easternmost territories of the occupation zone. The vultures begin to circle as even the slightest sign of dissent could spiral into a full-blown revolution. \n\nWill Aleksandra Dulkiewicz once again find herself swept up by the tide, this time for good?"

Liberals rejoice as despite the efforts of nationalists, reactionaries, and other madmen, the collaborationist forces of the Free City of Gdańsk have expanded their control to include the entirety of the voivodeship. Tipped by experts as having little-to-no chance of making a comeback after their initial collapse due to the overall resentment stemming from their betrayal of Poland during the invasion, Aleksandra Dulkiewicz was nevertheless able to mobilize enough support to not only hold on to Gdańsk, but strike out against all other warlords. Now the real work begins, as rubble from the fighting still covers the region. But with nobody breathing immediately down her neck for the first time in ten years, the ambitious politician should finally be able to implement her long-planned reforms. "

gdansk.1.t: "A Summit Ahead of Us"
#gdansk.1.desc: "Dear Madam President, Wishing you a warm welcome to the new year, it's time to consider the city's future steps in governance. Madam President, we have received information that will reshape the city's perspective – Gdańsk will host an important summit of the European Union. We are aware that the community's expectations are immense. Ahead of us lies a lot of planning, with preparations to create the right conditions for the participants. We must think about infrastructure, security, and an exceptional atmosphere. One of the key elements is the planned renovation of the European Solidarity Centre in Gdańsk, which is intended to become a symbol of a new order and cooperation. Your decisions will impact how the city is presented during the summit, what agreements will be signed, and what relationships will gain significance. I also wish to draw your attention to a troubling aspect – the population of the northern districts is growing impatient due to our focus on the development of the southern districts. I suggest a more detailed analysis of this situation in the near future. Another point for consideration is the issue of Solidarity. They could be helpful in certain situations, so I recommend keeping them on a short leash, but in a way that they don't feel cornered. They might still be of use. And Plichta... words fail me, he escaped from prison again and is somewhere within Gdańsk's territory. I also propose focusing on the further modernization of our military and restoring it to its former glory from before the war. Difficult times have arrived, everyone is looking to you, the fate of the city is in your hands. Good luck. \n Your esteemed advisor"

gdansk.2.t: "The Living Legend"
#gdansk.2.desc: " At a café on the Old Town square near the Neptune Fountain, Lech Wałęsa and Dukiewicz are seated at a table. Their conversation is lively, although from the perspective of a passerby, it looks like a meeting between two old acquaintances. The discussions mainly revolve around the ideals of Solidarity, though Lech is aware that Dukiewicz didn't meet him just to chat – he has deeper plans concerning him and his Solidarity movement. In Madam President's mind, similar musings are taking place. She contemplates whether it's worth allowing him to continue his actions or if it's time to rein him in. After a while, it becomes evident that there's a slow radicalization within some members of Solidarity. Particularly those residing in the northern parts of the city. Janusz Śniadek is their leader. Wałęsa reveals that he has received proposals from him to jointly organize protests at the Three Crosses Square during the EU summit in Gdańsk, but he declined. Recognizing the potential threat in Śniadek's actions, Dukiewicz decides to take active measures. Meanwhile, in Wałęsa's mind, a plan is forming on how to seize power in the city when the President is preoccupied with Śniadek. Unaware of this, she is already planning her next moves without thoroughly investigating the situation. Such actions further solidify Wałęsa's belief in the incompetence of the authorities. "Now, we just need to wait for the right moment, and Przymorze will ignite.""

#gdansk.3.desc: "With Śniadek acting autonomously for too long in his actions, it's time to finally have a talk with him." With these words, the President dispatched Wałęsa to speak with Śniadek. Little did she know that everything was going according to Wałęsa's plan. The Solidarity chairman entered a small garden behind his villa in Sopot and approached Janusz Śniadek, who had been invited for tea. They exchanged glances and began conversing, simulating a reprimand for their subordinate. However, Wałęsa was actually conveying to Śniadek that everything was proceeding as planned. He was to continue pretending with his actions, while Wałęsa would focus on further undermining the authorities by supporting investments in the south. His plan involved agitating the population to such an extent that people's nerves would fray, and they would take to the streets, causing President Dulkiewicz to willingly give up her seat. Dulkiewicz, observing the whole scenario from behind the windows, completely unaware, deemed the Solidarity matter closed. She believed she could now fully concentrate on the planned investments in the south and the 2027 EU summit. She doesn't yet know the severe price she might have to pay in the future for her arrogance and vanity, but for now, nothing foreshadows what might come... or is already coming. Wałęsa gathers people and resources in the northern districts, while Śniadek continues with his usual activities. The city's history is now being written by our hands, and what we will do depends solely on us and our decisions."

Thousands of onlookers behind barriers, and police security units, welcome the arriving dignitaries, ministers, and leaders from all corners of Europe. President Dulkiewicz is surrounded by her cabinet and, more importantly, by leaders of Eurocommissariats such as Donald Tusk and Grzegorz Schetyna. At a certain moment, everyone falls silent as the "Ode to Joy" resounds, played by musicians from the Baltic Philharmonic Orchestra. After the solemn opening ceremony and speeches by various personalities, the delegations of the member countries begin to make their way into the recently renovated monumental glass and metal structure of the European Solidarity Centre. The summit is divided into several sessions, during which specific topics will be debated. The summit spans three days: today, apart from the opening ceremonies, there will be a debate about the future of the European Union, as well as its goals and impact on the situations in Russia and Belarus. Tomorrow, a series of morning meetings with experts from various fields of Gdańsk's intelligentsia is scheduled. During the afternoon, there will be a session discussing the further stay of EU troops on Polish soil. In the evening, a conference of the authorities of the individual Eurocommissariats will take place. On the third and final day of the summit, there will be meetings to summarize the previous two days of discussions and debates, followed by celebratory closing events. Thanks to these events, the Free City of Gdańsk will gain even more significance in post-war Poland. I have great faith in this and hope that the summit will proceed as planned."

Professors, deans, and students are everywhere, but there's no shortage of casual onlookers either. After a series of street battles in the outer districts, for the first time, you can see President Dulkiewicz in person. It would seem that no one in their right mind would leave the tightly guarded European Solidarity Centre, where the authorities relocated after a wave of protests. Even though Wrzeszcz isn't far from the Three Crosses Square, it's a huge surprise that the president has decided on such a bold move. The meeting takes place in the massive main building of the university faculty. Presumably, this is an attempt to improve the image of the city's authorities, and who knows, it might just work. Upon entering the conference room, you see Dulkiewicz surrounded by professors and cameras. The atmosphere seems relaxed, although armed guards are scattered here and there. Wrzeszcz, as one of the key districts, is under government control and hasn't been plundered by the riots, although there were reports of clashes at Komorowski Square. The discussions are quite productive, and hopefully, they will impact the dire situation in the city. Promises of social stability and investments in the north are made at the end. Time will tell if it was worth casting a vote for her."

Although it might be a controversial statement, the northern districts are not being overlooked by President Dulkiewicz. On the contrary, for many years the seaside districts have been the center of urban development, whether in the civilian, educational, or communal sectors. Since early morning in my area, I see surveyors bustling around, conducting measurements for new investments. Rumor has it that they want to improve the road network for my Orunia. Currently, there are only a few local roads, but there's supposed to be a new express road connecting Road 91 with Road 89, serving as a relief for the congested S7 road. Additionally, they plan to build a new shopping mall in Ujeścisko. Such actions by the authorities will surely result in a significant increase in support. While specific plans haven't been disclosed to the public yet, they should be well received. I wonder if the residents of Przymorze are even aware of what's happening in our area. Despite the ambitious scope of the work, there are occasional signs of equipment and materials being gathered for these large investments.
