unification.91.desc:0 "The reputation of being the only state in Pomerelia unconquered by Germans during their invasion of Poland is a truly fierce one. And it takes an equally tough man to lead such a polity. \n\nThe instability within the country meant an end to comfortable travels and armchair politicking for Wojciech Cejrowski as years of struggle proceeded. Organizing his nationalistic following into a true militia, the eccentric globetrotter has created a cult of personality based around himself. His word is near gospel in Kociewie, with men ready to fight and die on his command. Sharpened by past conflict, constantly drilled into perfect shape, the army shattered all remnants of the traitors in Pomerelia. Repressions against the enemies of Poland now follow, with show trials and public executions demonstrating the fate of anyone who dares turn their back on the Fatherland."
unification.91.a:0 "Poland needs a strong ruler, as befits a third world dictatorship."
