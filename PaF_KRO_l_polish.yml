unification.133.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The New Krosno Republic unifies Subcarpathia!"
unification.133.desc:0 "Usually, when you take a man’s home, you never have to see his revenge. Try the same with Konrad Fijołek and the brave people of Krosno and they’ll make sure you live to regret your decision. Overthrown by the Ukrainian intervention and Grzegorz Braun’s insurrection, the experienced politician refused to give up the fight for the people of Subcarpathia. Joining up with refugees fleeing the invasion and establishing a new government in the town of Rymanów, Fijołek bided his time. Eventually, his chance came as chaos further engulfed the voivodeship. The politician now sits in his hometown of Rzeszów once more, trying to use his limited resources to rebuild the damaged city. Whether the staunchly conservative region will accept his brand of left-wing politics remains a mystery, but it seems above all, the people of Subcarpathia simply wish to enjoy peace for the first time in years."
