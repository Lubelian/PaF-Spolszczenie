gdansk.bum.1.t: "Dealer's Conundrum"
gdansk.bum.1.desc: "The Arms Dealer's warehouse, which used to buzz with life as employees busily stored and distributed weapons for sale across various parts of Poland, has lately been growing emptier. The decreasing number of orders, coupled with increasing obligations to their paymasters, has necessitated laying off part of the workforce. Meanwhile, in the office, there is a monthly reckoning of bills, obligations, and the planning of sales strategies for the upcoming month.\n\n- And how is this new storage system supposed to help increase turnover? - asks the irritated Dealer, reaching for a pack of Radomskie - I'll tell you, it won't help at all. What's the use of introducing a new standard for grenade crates and freeing up a few square meters of the hall for other weaponry when we don't even have anyone to sell them to?\n\n- As for that, I have a certain idea - replied the strategist in a calm tone - Have you heard about the planned meeting in Gdańsk?"
gdansk.bum.1.a: "I'm listening..."

gdansk.bum.2.t: "Homeland's Call"
gdansk.bum.2.desc: "- And you say it's feasible? - Max asks in his office, watching the Revolutionists training through the window.\n- Of course - replies the man in black - I'm not saying it will be an easy task, but your soldier with the right skills should handle it smoothly.\n\n- And what do I get out of this? - Kolonko asks, sitting in his leather chair and opening a folder on his desk with the financial report for the last quarter.\n- We are aware of your financial problems. We also know about the lack of weaponry among your units. We can address these issues and, at the same time, provide you with an opportunity for a 'return' to your homeland, along with your entourage - the man in black responds, adjusting his tie - Our employers will prepare everything. We ask you to choose the right person.\n\nMax, sinking into his chair, replies:"
gdansk.bum.2.a: "I think I already have the right candidate"

gdansk.bum.3.t: "Unforeseen Alliances"
gdansk.bum.3.desc: "In the headquarters in Kaliningrad, coordinated chaos reigns as the ongoing war on the northern borders of Poland takes an unexpected turn. No one expected that the conflict with the marauders from the impoverished north of Poland would turn into another Ukraine. Meanwhile, an unexpected sound echoes in Colonel Glishin's office which turns out to be an incoming call.\n- Glishin - the Colonel says, clearing his throat into the receiver.\n\n- Vanya, it's me. Listen, a shipment will arrive at your old airport under the Baltic within the next week. You need to prepare a boat and documents for him. The documents will come in a package in three days. Can you handle that? - the voice on the other side responds.\n- Wait, documents? Him? Is he one of your people? - 'Vanya' wonders - What are you guys up to again?\n\n- If you help me with this, you can go to Putin and tell him you came up with it yourself. You'll get a promotion, and you know, where there's a promotion, there's a bonus - a dry voice from the other end says.\n- What kind of idea is this again? What are you scheming over there? - Glishin responds, growing impatient."
gdansk.bum.3.a: "Okay, I'm in. Where do you want this boat?"

gdansk.bum.4.t: "Under Baltic Skies"
gdansk.bum.4.desc: "Inactive, former German airport under the Baltic Sea saw an approaching aircraft for the first time in decades. However, it wasn't a roaring World War II plane returning from a mission on the Eastern Front, but a small, unarmed helicopter. Simultaneously, the roar of military vehicles adorned with the Russian emblem on their doors can be heard on the ground. On both land and in the air, an almost uncoordinated dance takes place; on one side, a helicopter prepares for landing, and on the other, soldiers, led by a colonel, disembark and head in its direction.\n\nFinally, after a long time of soldier positioning and a successful helicopter landing, a man in a black suit disembarks, speaking to the colonel \n- Is everything ready?\n- Yes, we've prepared the boat at the edge of the spit along with the documents delivered by you - colonel replied - Where's the package?\nAs he said this, another man in a navy suit disembarks from the helicopter, holding a sizable suitcase.\n- There he is - the man in black replied - Escort our friend to the boat."
gdansk.bum.4.a: "- Quickly, the boat is this way"

gdansk.bum.5.t: "Monthly Report of the Police Officers in Nowy Dwór, Page 5"
gdansk.bum.5.desc: "The incident occurred around 5 p.m. A young man dressed in a suit, driving a silver Skoda sedan, was traveling on road number 501 towards Mikoszewo from the Stegna side. After the vehicle was stopped by the police unit due to a malfunctioning rear right position light, Officer Kowalski, along with Officer Miłbracki, assisted by Polizeihauptmeister Hans Muller from the European Police Command in Gdańsk, who was conducting routine checks of police units outside Gdańsk at that time, began to identify the driver.\n\nPolizeihauptmeister Muller noted in the protocol severe negligence on the part of Officers Kowalski and Miłbracki, involving a lack of situational awareness regarding the ongoing preparations for the arrival of European representatives in Gdańsk, citing, "In every car, there could be a potential perpetrator with a will and possibility of disrupting the summit". In Polizeihauptmeister Muller's report, increased vigilance of patrols and an enhancement of their presence in the area are recommended."

gdansk.bum.7.t: "Announcement of 2027 European Summit"
gdansk.bum.7.desc: "As it was planned, Aleksandra Dulkiewicz, the President of Free City of Gdańsk, announced the 2027 European Summit in Gdańsk. She wishes to mostly focus on the future of the European Union, after it was weakened due to secession of the Visegrad Group and invasion of Poland. The further federalisation talks and issue of Polish warlords are expected to be the main points of discussion.\n\nMany speculate that the President will try to use the summit to extend her influence on Polish occupied lands, overshadowing the Eurokommisars, however for that she would need to gain Von Der Leyen’s blessing. After the summit, which will happen in the European Solidarity Centre, the guests will partake in the tour of the Old Town, and see many places, like the famous Gdańsk Crane."
gdansk.bum.7.a: "Is she trying to become the President of Poland?"

gdansk.bum.8.t: "Finale of the Summit"
gdansk.bum.8.desc: "A tragedy struck the City of Gdańsk, with an explosion that disrupted the long awaited European Summit. During the trip of the Old Town after the Summit, just as the group approached the famed Crane and posed for a group photo, a bomb put in the Crane exploded. Two German Generals were rushed to the hospital and soon were declared dead. As for the host, President Dulkiewicz, the shock wave threw her in front of a nearby Żabka shop, only suffering a minor concussion. Other guests were fine, but the Summit was over. And as such, any ambitions Dulkiewicz had for a blessing to unify Poland, died with the generals.\n\nThere are many speculations for who may have been behind this act, however one thing is known: the cracks in German Occupation are finally showing, and are larger than anyone thought."
gdansk.bum.8.a: "It really did end up with a gas."
