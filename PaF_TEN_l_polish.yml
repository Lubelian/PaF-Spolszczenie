unification.155.desc:0 "Unsettling news are reaching us from the Lubelskie region. The entire voivodeship is said to have fallen under control of Tadeusz Sznuk’s peculiar government.\n\nSznuk has been known for being the host of a TV trivia show called \"One of the Ten\" for three decades now, and he seems to somehow use its simple format as the basis for his political system. This alone would be bizzare enough, but the reports claim that the population of the so called Decimal State is being subjected to increasingly extreme repressions. Its citizens are being routinely forced to take part in trivia contests, and failures to correctly answer the questions result in harsh punishments, with some rumors even saying that low enough scores sometimes lead to summary executions. How did Sznuk, a famously well-mannered gentleman end up establishing such a twisted system is unknown, but his increasing power is certainly worrying."
